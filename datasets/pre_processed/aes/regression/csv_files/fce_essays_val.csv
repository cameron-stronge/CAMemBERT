462," Dear Sir/Madam During my holiday in London I decided to go to the theatre. I found your advertisement in the tourism officis and how the musical ""Over the rainbow"" seemed to be a good option I choose it. The problem is that there was some differences between the advertisement and the show I've seen. First, Danny Brook wasn't the star that night, he was replaced by an actor that seemed  a rookie. Another problem, the show started at 20:15 in the place of 19:30 and when it finished I couldn't have a dinner because the theatre's restaurant was closed (it closes at 22:00). Moreover, there wasn't any discounts availables (I'm  student but I paid  a full ticket). How it was explained above, I'm not satisfied and I want to be   refund. yours faithfully  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. She's the sister of my ex-girlfriend which is called Eingrid. She was a really nice person and loved me a lot. We'll understand why I'm writing in the past. Last weekend we diced to go to the bach with Pat and Nick (her boyfriend). When we arrived there Eingrid and Pat decided to take a sunbath while I and Nik walked in the sand. Lyter a long time walking we decided to return and how the weather was so hot we  found a place to drink something. Then I found an ex-girlfriend that Eingrid hates. We had a little conversation and suddenly she kissed me, but I refused to continue. I called Nick to go search  the girls (he was in the WC) and said goodbye to she. When we met the girls Eingrid was furious, she said  me that Pat had saw me kissing another girl and our relationship was over! I'm really very unlucked.  ",26.0
343," I would like to know some informations about the advertisement of the show. First of all, why  the show began at 20:15, not at 19:30 as indicated in the advertisement. I waited quite one hour to see the show, and what happened with the actor? I came to that show only for see him and when the actor appear, it was another one. There is more! Where were the discounts that I should have earned? I was very disappointed with that! After the show my sun wanted to eat some biscuits and when I see the restaurant closed, I gave up, I told to my sun that we'll never come back here again. The restaurant was closed because there wasn't  electricity you should close the theatre untill the restaurant get appropriate to use. I was totaly unsatisfied with the theatre and I would like to have my money back if it's possible. I thank you for read my letter, I hope you write for me back, and don't forget my money!  [SEP]  I am writing what I think what kind of clothes will people wear 100 years from now . As we see the clothes are changing every hour. People  inventing new kinds of clothes and people  buying and wearing differents clothes. It is difficult to say how people will be wearing clothes 100 years from now. In each country, each people wear differents kinds of clothes, like, people in Brazil wear shorts, T-shirts or only without them, in Saudi Arabian they wear strange clothes, if you analyse   the point of view  who doesn't live in Saudi Arabia. I'm quite sure that people in all   world will be wearing very differents clothes in the future because , especialy women,  like to be very elegant and beautiful will create and invent all kinds of clothes to anybody and that's it.

313," Dear manager, During my stay in London, I visited all the most famous place and I enjoyed  a lot during this days. I love London's musical shows and I read the advertisement for the show called ""over the rainbow"". I've gone to many musical shows where the main actor was Danny Brook and I can say that he is really good. It was my last night in London and I decided to go to this musical show. When I asked for the price I was surprised becaused the seller told  there wasn't any discount available. I showed the advertisement to him and he said it was wrong and I paid the normal price. I bought the ticket for the second session and I went to the theatre at seven o'clock. I had been waiting half an hour outside the theatre and finally it started at a quarter past eight. I was angry about all of this problems but I was disappointed when I realised the advertisement was wrong with the actor's name. When the musical show finished I went to the theatre's restaurant and it was closed because it was too late, so I couldn't have dinner there, as it was announced . I wasn't a good evening and I would like to have my money back. Waiting for your answer.  [SEP]  Modern technology has changed my daily life and I'll try to explain it. We have been using personal computers for nine years and it's one of the most important changes. Last year I spent ten hours looking for information for my homework. The subject was ""What's happening in Irak?"" I started my research in the town's library and all the information I collected was from a local newspaper. After two hours I thought that all of this information was writted from a foreign point of view and it wasn't the native opinion. I used my computer for collecting reports from  internet and I can promise I found so much information that I couldn't analize it in two weeks. Internet has changed our daily life: you can find whatever you want. Do you want to have a different lunch? Do you want to organize a different holiday in a strange place? You can find there all you need and more! I can't imagine my parents playing in the street without watching the TV. I couldn't life without modern music. I'm not interested in films without special effects.. And what about mobile telephones? Changes won't stop it's caming  the WAP technology (you'll buy a cake in a corner's machine without any coin, only one call), digital TV, virtual reality and more... ",30.0

About my Accommodation I prefer the tents, I like them, every year I go 15 days out with my tent and some friends. I like to sleep outside on the grass. The weather will be no cold doesn't it? I'd like to play gold and tennis, I practis both since I was young, and I like them, but I don't have enough time to play, and my level isn't as good as I'll like. In order to know what sort of the clothes I have to take, please can you inform me about the normal weather for this periode? I'm not used to hight temperatures, I don't like so much the hot weather.

274," Dear Sir or Madam, I am a foreign woman who had a week's holiday in London and decided to go to the theatre to see a musical show. That show wasn't as it  supposed to be and it is for that reason that I am writting to you. One of the problems is that a couple of actors, Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, were the ones supposed to act and a different actor took Danny's place, it was disappointing! The second show was supposed to start at 19:30, but to make the matters worse, it started at 20.15, so after the show I couldn't got to the cinema. Apart from that I couldn't visit the theatre restaurant after the show because it was closed for  holidays. On top of everything the tickets didn't offer any discounts, so  the last day I couldn't buy the present for my neighbour. I am writting to ask  a refund of the £55 which I spent on the ticket for the miserable show. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully. Jane Smythe  [SEP]  I am going to write about how has modern technology changed our daily life. First of all I think that technology has been one of the most important inventions of human  and that without it we couldn't be where we are wright now. One of the best examples is the car: in a lot of cities around the world, cars can be seen in the streets all day long. During the last decade the number of people who has a particular car has increased very fast. On the other hand people who hasn't any cars, can also be helped by technology: they can use the public transport like the train or the bus, which is also a comfortable form of travelling. But if you want a fastest  transport, the plane is the perfect one! But technology can also help you at home if you use modern machines for cleaning your house, clothes or dishes. Apart from that, technology also helps in hospitals. Every  time  more machines help doctors and nurses with their difficult tascs. In contrast, technology is very bad for the nature: if we use cars we contaminate , and many cars are being used every day! On balance I think that evidently technology has got more advantages than disadvantages. ",24.0
1138," Dear Mr Robertson, Thank you for your effort, which you have made to organize this three days programm in London and I am sure that we will have a great time there especially in the National Art Gallery. Nevertheless, the students in my class have some suggestions for you  how to make it even more interesting. The thing is that we have seen an advertisment for the London Fashion and Leisure Show. It will be held in  Central Exhibition Hall in London on Tuesday, 14th of March, from 10.00 to 19.00. Naturally, all the students are interested in it because the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles will be shown there. Futhermore, students can enter free! We are concerned that this is a great and the only opportunity for us to see this show, as it takes place only once a year and only in London. Certainly, we do not refuse to take part in other activities in London. Probably, you will agree just to put  London Fashion and Leisure Show instead of  Science Museum and shopping on Tuesday. Thank you for your attenlion and understanding. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  The Home of the Future Dear Reader, I have decided to describe my home of the future or, in other words, the place where people will live in 100 years. Well, I suppose that almost everything in  future house will be automatic and will obey to what people say. Perhaps, there will be personal computers, which will control every thing, every item of furiture, light, temperature. Moreover, they will be able to create a special climate for each room. But, on the other hand, people will still have to programm them, as they have to do nowadays. Maybe children will not have to go to school, they just will stay in their rooms and study from  computer,  some kind of on-line education. All the rubbish, dust, dirty dishes, plates, caps will be washed and cleaned automaticly. It is possible that only one computer will do this all and it will have its own personality, voice, eyesight.. This will be your home, another member of your family and your house or flat together. This is my opinion of the Home of the Future and I wish I could live in it. ",35.00
928," 13th june 2000 Dear Ms Ryam, I was very happy to receive your letter since I was eager to spend some time in the USA. I would like to reach the camp in july, and spend there the last two weeks of the month because in August I must start studying for my examinations. As to accomodation I would like to choose a tent because I am used to travelling with my sleeping bag and my tent all over Europe. As far as activities are concerned I would prefer Basketball and Climbing. I am very good at basketball, and even if I am not a tall boy, I am a good playmaker and I play in a local team. As to climbing I am almost inexperienced but I would like to improve. I would like to ask you  some other things. Which kind of clothes have I to put in my case? I would like to know, for instance, whether the evenings there are cold or hot. Please let me know if the Camp California accepts credit cards I look forward to hearing from you Yours sincerely Fabienne Mull  [SEP]  13th June 2000 Dear Kim, I was very happy to receive your last letter. As you know I had a great time helping at a PoP Concert. I was at the concert when I met a friend of mine whose job is to organise shows like that. He told me He needed a boy who could help on stage. As you known I can do a little of everything so I accepted. I connected wires, I caried loudspeakers, and so on. When the show started I was on the stage close to  famous singers, Bono Vox and David Bowie. Towards the end of the concert I hansled a bottle of wine to Poolo Conte. I couldn't believe in it! Poolo Conte asked me to drink with Him. As you know He's my favorite singer. We started talking about music and I asked Him many things about His texts, which are beautiful but sometimes difficult to understand. I think I won't never forget that evening. I'm looking forward to hearing from you. With my best wishes Fabienne ",34.0
295," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to let you know  our unbelievable experiences which we had when we went to the theatre to see the musical show 'OVER THE RAINBOW.' First of all, I am a fan of Danny Brook but he was absent because of sick. It made me disappointed very much. Moreover, he made many mistakes. Secondly, although we had booked the tickets 3 days before we went to the theatre, we could not be given any discounts only because we had done at a travel agency. Finally, I am going to write about the theater, the Circle Theatre. The show supposed to start at 19:30, but it started at 20:15. Because of that, we missed the train and we had to stay one more night in London. It was your responsibility. We would like you to pay back the fee of the show and pay us  that hotel's fee as well. I would recommend you to show that the restaurant is closed on Monday. I could not have dinner. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Fashion of the Future If you asked the young people what they spend their money the most in, most of them would answer 'clothes'. In these days, new fashions have been passing by very quickly. From my point of view, young people tend to wear the clothes which they can show their skin. For example, short skirts and tops like an under-wear. I think young people would wear smaller clothes which  they look like  almost naked even in winter. I suppose that a scientist could invent new kinds of materials which are warm and thick. It could be happened that people wear the clothes which ancient people used to wear, like skirts made of leaves. Next, I predict about patterns of clothes. The animal-pattern is catching up now. It might be possible that the fish-pattern come up in 100 years. However, fashion changes too fast to predict. I think fashion changes very quickly so that people are interested in those changes.

658," Dear Sir/Madam First of all I would like to say thanks for your letter and your care about your customers. I was absolutely threaled to resive  news about my win in a competition. Your letter contains  few questions about  detailes of my holiday which I would like to clarify for you. The first is  time. I am only able to go on holiday in July, because the other time I have college, which I can't be missed. The second is accommodation. I old rather prefer stay in log cabins than live in tents. I don't like night cold and moscitos. I  so glad, that I will get  chance to do activities in the camp. I play basketball and at tennis. I  quite good at tennis. What about basketball is. I played in  school team, and was one of the best players by the end of this season. There is one more thing which I would like to know about. It is  clothes and money. Should I have any special , if yes what kind of wear it is. And of course there will be expenses. Can you inform me how much money should I have and can I have some information about prices  to visit local places of interests. At the end I would like ones more to say thanks for your letter and I look forward to hearing from you by post with all  detailes about  holiday. Yours faithfyly  [SEP]  I hate shopping but in the other hand sometimes you can have fun at it. In my opinion, it dependes on your mood, your financial ability, off course where you are going to do shopping and what you are going to buy. Usualy people don't have time for shopping. You've just finished your long hours at work, you  tide, you had  row with your boss but you are still going to do shopping. And what  you have. There are huge queus to  tills, noise, hussle, poor custumer service. You've got more stress, you feel fed up and finaly when you got home you think that shopping is not that enjoyable as you thought. For example a lot of people do not like to do shopping in big stores. It takes hours to buy something. There are so many varaity of products, different prices, different quality. You should walk miles around  store to find what you wanted. Yes, there is  big plus for  big store of course. You can find everything in one place, instead of small shops which is specialised on one product. And people spend all weekends walking around shopping cities and high streets in trills to buy something. Nower days tecnical progress gets close to us, to usual custumers.  Internet is one of the issue at this problem. Without any hussle, seating in your chear in front of your computer you in  second can get in at any shop who has  internet site, most of the big companies have it, get all  information about  product, get  cheaper price and buy it.

380," Dear Sir/Madam I went to see 'over the rainbow' presented by the circle theater. I was really disappointed therefore I am writing a  complain. Firstly I bought the ticket because I like Danny Brook's acting but in the show someone was acting his part. Also the person was not really good at acting. Secondly the time on the leaflet is totaly wrong. It said it will start at 19:30. Infact it started t 20:15. I was waiting for 45 minuts. Thirdly the ticket was no discount and after the show I visited  theater restaurant but it was close because the show started too late. Finaly last nigh was not  perfect evening. (Therefore) I want to have  money back and I hope you will think about these problems. Your faithfully  [SEP]  I am writing an article about  fashion of the future to the international student magazine. Fashion are always changing therefore it is really difficult to say what sort of clothes people wear in  future. But when I heard the word of future, I have  image of metalic colour so that  my imagination they are wearing metalic or bright colour cloth. May be they have more different types of colour than now. However I think the style of fashion will not have big differences because I believe that fashion is in a circle. The mean of this is all our fashion styles come from history. For example our fashion style at the moment is comes from 70's fashion. We always repeat the fashion with adding some new fashion at that time.  I think the people will wear clothes which are metalic or bright colourful colour with mixture of history and future fashion style. in  future. ",25.0
161," Dear Sir/Madam: I'd like to complain about your 'Best' musical show that I went to when I'd a week's holiday in London. I felt really disappointed because the things you said in the advertisement wasn't true. I went there at 19.00 because the show started at 19.30 as the advertisement said but I queued for at least an hour because the ticket machine broke down. Finally, after an hour, when my term came to buy the entrance ticket, you staff said I couldn't have a discount and so as anyone. However I bought the ticket even  it was more expensive because I'd been queuing for ages and I really wanted to see my favourite idol, Danny Brook. But when the show started, they said Danny wasn't there because of his illness and I felt very upset and dismayed about it because the situation I had was unlike what the advertisement said. After the boring show finished, I was hungry and I decided to go to your theatre restaurant but the restaurant was closed after 19.00. So what's the point  to say 'visit our restaurant after the show'? I'd a very disappointing evening and my anger influenced me for the rest of my holidays. I'd like to know if you can give the money back to me or I'll write letters to all the media departments to show how tricky you were. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. He went to see the headmaster and told him all the truth. Tim was the one who threw the paper aeroplane to the headmaster and Jon was the one who said some bad words behind the headmaster  after he punished Jon. The headmaster was extremely angry about it and he gave both students a heavy punishment, which was suspended from school for a week. This happened in the Thursday afternoon. When everyone finished their lunch, they all got into their classrooms quickly because they all knew that the headmaster would walk round the school every Thursday. But some naughty students in my class were throwing paper aeroplanes when the teacher was writting something on the board. Unfortunately, one of the paper planes flew out of the window and hit directly to the headmaster's head. Everyone was laughing and the headmaster's face was full of anger. He then punished Jon but the one who did  was Tim so Jon was very angry and he said something bad about the headmaster among us. Pat heard that and  went to see the headmaster straight after school. The headmaster went to see Jon and Tim and punished  their bad behaviours. After that event happened, Pat was Jon and Tim's enemy. They both got into trouble because of him. They do hate him so much.

It will be called ""A day in the life of the mysterious student X."" It will be shot just as if the viewers were student X, not seeing him but being him. He will have breakfast, take a shower, get dressed, etc...  So  viewers will. Student X will meet friends on his way to school and start talking with them. Actually one of us will hold the camera while another will stand next to him, as the ""voice"" of X. At school we want to show ""sights and sounds"" from all  lessons (about 5 minutes each). Student X will answer questions, speak with his classmates, even cheat at an exam! During the chemistry and biology classes, ""we"" will make experiences. Of course we will also show other activities such as PE the lunch break and the theater workshop. The main purpose is to show the ""real"" life of an unreal student. Therefore we want this film to be informative and funny as well. We expect to show our production during the graduation party. ",30.0

We need to show what students interests in and which subject  are interested . I think Science are one of the interesting subject in school. It is very interesting and fun with the experement. Lot and lot of experements which give out quit an interest and amazing results and I think Science is very useful in life. We can see a lot of interest faces on the students wile we  filming them. Also it  not a very easy subject so we can capture other students faces in confuse and puzzal. Also drama is one of the most fun and interest subject. We can see students expressing their feeling, wonderful and excitting story that the student made up or from a will know story. Another excitting subject which most of the students likes very much is P.E. Many students like to play sports. (I'm one of them). It  a good idea to have that in. Plus you can use me as a main person because I'm very good at it. We can also film life after school. After school activities is one of the main thing in school.

According to my great experience on climbing, I prefer accommodation in log cabins because in tents we can't sleep or being well with such cold! Never the less in summer we can't resist such hot! In base of your activities option, I would say that climbing is one of my first option, as I've mentioned and I really think that photography will help me in my other adventures. I would like to ask if we need  money for paying  or baying something because you didn't specify what is included in the trip, such as food. I really apreciate this kind of trip and I'm really thank  your truly attention. Yours sincirely: Camila Playhouse.  [SEP]  The truth of Shopping Shopping... a great and emotion statement, don't you think? Every one think that shopping in the best way to carry off your problems and, in fact a big solution of many problem or estrés, boring, or only for distraction. But the question is: Why shopping is not always enjoyable?. For many people, shopping had always been only for one kind of elite, or social class; not all people can go shopping and buy hundreds and thousands of stuff in those big malls as  distraction. Let's talk about women; nightmare! women can't resist the fact of shopping and they are dissapointed when they don't have the wants to shop. The shopmania is really unstapped. I know women that make everything they can to buy only a dress, or even worst, women that buy things that was nothing to do with them, for example, snap, esculptures, kitchen tissues, or eveything on telemarketing that really are unuseful, but the fact of have it "" there"" they can  resist There are many facts to prove that shopping is not ""pretty and armonious"", but believe me,  is not always enjoyable.

360," Dear Sir or Madam, A few weeks ago, I went to London, and I decided to go to the theatre and see a musical show, called ""Over the Rainbow."" I'm very sory to tell you that I had a very disappointing evening. First, I got there at 7:00 pm, because the show was about to start at 7:30 pm, and I need some time to by the tickets, I by two tickets of £20 and when I ask for a discount, they didn't give it to me, then I keep waiting for the show to start untill 8:15 pm. Then when the show finally started I got very disappointed because, I really wanted to see Danny Brook, but instead of him there was any other actor. Lately when the show finished, I planed to go to the restorant and get some food, but I was close, because it was being repaired. I will be very thankfull if your could return  me half or some of my money, or even to make the corresponding discount.

I'd just like to know if the tents at the camp are based on sharing and how many people is there in one tent. I really appreciate the choice of activities at the camp. It was hard to choose only two. I've chosen tennis and sailing. I've played tennis since I was eight years old and I'm very good at it. I'm also good at swimming and surfing but I'd like to try sailing. I was always attracted to it but never had an opportunity . Is it possible to start to learn it at Camp California? I'd also like to know how far is it to the nearest village and how much cash do I need for  two-weeks stay at the camp? Do I need to bring with me some special gear or equipment? I'm looking forward to hear from you again. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Kim In my last letter I promised to write  you about my experience working at  pop-concert. The job came unexpectedly as my friend, who was supposed to work there, broke her leg just two days before the event. So she asked me to fill her position. Even  I had planned something else to do I agreed because she's my very good friend. The concert was due to start at 7 o'clock but we had to be there two hours before the beginning. First I was supposed to help at the refreshment spot for the fans but some 15 minutes before beginning I was told to go to the backstage and help with the refreshment for the musicians, technicians and others who worked there. It was very hectic there as everyone was a bit nervous but I saw the main stars and even managed to talk to them. When they started to play I was told to change my post again. This time I was helping the medical workers who had full hands with fainted teenage girls. First, it seemed to me odd because I didn't understand why they faint, but as the concert went on, the heat in the air was increasing and so was the number of the fainted. It wasn't funny anymore and I didn't know what to do first. I was really shocked by the view of crying and shaking but absolutely happy girls sitting or lying on the floor. However, I manage to listen  the music and I must admit that I liked it. I actually injoyed it working there and I wouldn't hesitate to work there again. As I know you like this ",37.0
965," Dear Helen I am very surprised for have received your letter in which you explained to me that I have won  prize in your competition. After that, I would like to say Thanks, I never have won any price at all. Now, I will answer your requests. In reference about the date of the travel, I would like to travel in July because at the moment I am working at the University and I only have July to take my holidays. As  state in your letter I have to choose the accommodation type . I would prefer to stay in  tents because since I was a child I have being using this type of accommodation. I used to go to campings. About camp activities I would prefer to do basketball and photography. I have choosen these activities because actually I am playing with  university team, and photography is my favoorate hobby. I have recently bought a new camera. Finally let me know what kind of clothes will be the most suitable at camp. Is  necesarilly bring to me money in there? I look forward to hearing from you Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Kim I am writen to you telling  about my experience at a pop concert. It began when ours common friends Martha, ofered me  to be a organization member at the concert, obviously I accepted. Now I can tell you that it was an amaizing challange for me because I never did anything like that. My duties like a organization member were diferent, the firts day I had to pick the bands up at the airport,  for it I hired a van. The following day I was the person who provide the meals for all the organization staff and besides every day I was at the back-stage supporting the catering staff. Particularly I am pleased to had know the most popular pop stars in the world. Hopping to hear from you Best wishes ",23.0
144," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to you to complain about the unexpected evening I had when I went to see the musical show ""Over the rainbow"" in your theatre. First of all, the time for the second session was meant to be at 19.30, but somehow it began at 20.15, which was a 45 minutes delay. I was also expecting to see the actor Danny Brook performing, but a different actor did, who did not perform as well as Danny Brook does. This was another disappointing thing of that evening. But my complain does not finish here. It was of my understanding that discounts were available on the tickets, as the advertisement showed, but there were no discounts. And what is more, I could not go to the restaurant after the show, as it was closed because the main chef was ill and could not come to work. Definetely, it was not my perfect evening at all and under these circumstances I really believe you should give me my money back. Looking forward to hearing from you, Alessandra Lane.  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. As soon as she arrived home, she phoned her best friend Sue and told her everything, all details included. She also told her not to tell anybody about it because it was a secret. The thing was that Mary couldn't resist the secrecy and phoned her cousin, who also studied in our school. She was the director of the school newspaper and Mary didn't tell her it was a secret, so on monday at 9 a.m. MY SECRET was published in the school paper and at the end of the day, eventually everybody had read the ""news"". I didn't know it was published as I didn't read the paper and no one told me anything, either. But I soon knew it because when I went to the school canteen everybody was staring at me and whispering to eachother. At first I didn't realise what was happening, but then a friend of mine told me that everyone knew that I was going out with the most popular boy in the school and that we had kissed eachother in the park last friday. Suddenly my face went all red and I ran towards the toilet. I had never felt so embarrassed and miserable in my life, but luckily next day almost everybody forgot about it. That day I swore to myself that I would never trust anybody again. ",39.0
52," Dear Ms Clark, I am writing to thank you for organising the International Arts Festival, in which I participated this year, and to give you my opinion about it. I think that organising this event was a great idea. I was very pleased when I read your advertisement for the festival. One reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events was also an excellent idea. It encouraged me to take part in the festival. Despite all this I would like to complain about some detailes. First of all stars were supposed to come from all around the world. Apparently there were artists from only six countries. All the concerts were great, but some concert halls were too small. There was a terrible lack of room and fresh air inside them. I would also like to suggest  you to try and make more plays and films available next year. I trust you will give this matter your great attention. I look forward to visiting  International Arts Festival next year. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Mary, Thanks for your letter. I'm sorry for not having written earlier, but I've had an exhausting exam session at school. It was very interesting to hear about  rules in England. The rules in Poland are quite similar to those discribed in your letter. We are not allowed to talk during the lesson and we have to do our homework every day. Usually we don't have to wear school uniforms, but there are schools, in which there is such obligation. In most of the schools students have to change their shoes in order not to make the floor dirty. If I could change anything, I would probably lessen the amount of homework. It's hard to find any spare time sometimes! What about home rules? Well, we both know that parents are the ones who rule at home. All the things we're not allowed to do depend on them. Anyway, I must finish now. Has your dog already recovered? I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon. Lots of love, ",35.00
324," Dear Manager of the theatre: I am writing a letter to complain about the musical show I saw last week when I was in London. I thought that I would have a great time there, but I was really disappointed in that evening. You said there would be stars such as Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, whose music is my favourate, but the musicians were actually some other people whose names I had never heard of. In the advertisement of the show, you said it would begin at 19.30, actually it was 45 minutes delay. The discounts of tickets that you mentioned were not exist. It could make things worse that the visit to your theatre restaurant, which had already been closed because of  lack of customers, was canceled. However, what a let down! I would be grateful if you could give  the money back. If I cannot get your satisfying reply within a month I shall go to the consumer protection organisation to sue you. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully.  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed our daily life. Our life has been influenced by modern technology. Five years ago, you could be proud of your 486 computer, which can only be put inside a museum as an antique now. Then how does it changed our daily life? I have been an enthusiast of music for a long time, I used  tape player and I felt it was excellent. Today, there are multi-choices such as  discman (CD player). MD walkman and MP3 player, which are considered to be more portable and have  better timbre. Communication has been more conventional, we can simply make a phone call,  sent e-mails or faxes instead of writing letters and waiting for a long time. Especially the improvement  of personal computer has greatly helped the spread of information by using  internet, you can book newspaper, magazines,  even go shopping online. Therefore, our life has been influenced and changed by  developing of technology. In conclusion, we should work hard to learn knowledges, making the future better and better. ",27.0
722," I'm pleaseant to win the first prize in your competition - two weeks at Camp California in the USA. As I'm an artist student in a particular College, I only can go to your Camp California in July, because in this month I got no  class, and I'm free to do whatever I want to. I'd like  log cabins as my accomodation, because it's safer and cleaner than  tents and I wouldn't share it to anyone. Painting and Photography are the activities good for me. They fit to myself because my art work develops itself in these areas. In Painting I talk about human beings in this world, in big canvases; and in Photography, with Collages, I talk about anger and guilty in the families' lines. So in Camp California I would like to keep me on touching to these areas. I'd like to ask you to send me $1000 for my art knowledge. With this amount I could buy a lot of art books, and records. In summarize, art and music need to be kept with me throughout these two weeks to not forget my artistic life.  [SEP]  Shopping is something made, which do not need to be enjoyable. We can analize when shopping is enjoyable,  when it is not. There is joy in shopping when it is made by ourselves to ourselves. It means buying whatever we like, just like clothes, records, rings, and books. What we like is based in our relationship to another people, in the work or in the family. So we have enjoyable when we buy what we like following another people's views. On the other hand, sickness in ourselves  our relatives made us unhappy to buy. It is an obligation shopping  medicines, clothes to winter, doctor visites, and so forth. A death in the family is not also an enjoyable shopping experience, because it is the highest point of the sickness. Buying coffins and graveyards to bury relatieves is not as enjoyable as buying clothes. In summarizing shopping can be enjoyable or not depending of our healthy state. Giving examples:  we are healthy we buy clothes and Records, we enjoy ourselves;  we are sick, or our relatives , we buy medicines  we  not enjoy ourselves because it is an obligation. ",23.0
466," Dear Sir or Madam, I have recently been to the Circle Theatre to see a musical show. It was advertised as London's Newest and best musical show. However, it had been a very dissappointing evening for me. Firstly, it was mentioned that there were going to be two starrings but, in fact, only an actor were performing on the show. Secondly, there was a delay on the show which supposed to started at 19.30 but, it was actually started at 20:15. This really upset me as no notice were given before the show. Thirdly, the advertisment said that the discounts were avaliable but, the ticket seller said that there was no discount allowing or avaliable. In addition, the advertisment mentioned that  restaurant will be opened after the show but it was closed because, short of cooker. Finally, I would like to ask for  money back for the ticket due to the disapointing evening out and  unreliable advertisement you have created. I am looking forward to hearing from you as soon as possible. Yours faithfully, Cook Phatosub.  [SEP]  Nowaday, modern technology is becomming very essential to our daily life. As it is another important factor which affects our life, apart from money, health, food and house. The reasons it is important to us are, first of all, if you think bout life without computers, communication machines and transportation machines. We wouldn't be able to sort out informations and datas this quickly. Secondly, no one could communicate on the phone through countries or even through houses as immediate as nowadays. Lastly, it would take people months and months to travel to the other side of the world and also the journey would be much more dangerous than travel by plane. Without all this you life would definately change back to the same position as it were 50 or more years ago. Put it in another words, modern technology has changed our life to became more advanced in every ways. On the other hand, the affects that it has on our daily life is not always good as sometime, the technology went wrong and out of hand of people who control it can cause disaster accidents, for example: plane crashes, trains crashed and  explosion of nuclears bomb. If this continue to happen our life would be very misarable as accident happens all the time. Therefore, it is important to get it exactly right. ",19.0
236," Dear Mr Manager of the Circle Theatre During my last holiday week in London I went to the Circle Theatre after reading the advertisement of the ""Over the rainbow"" show. I wanted to spend my leisure time well by taking in that cultural event. How stupid of me! I felt really disappointed. First of all in the advertisement  was written, as I had read that before, that Danny Brook would be starring in the show. Unfortunately, the different actor stood in for in it. The time of the beginning of the show was written at half past two p.m. and at half past seven that evening, again. Lack of my time made me to go at the evening show. And unfortunately again, from some reasons it was postponed to quarter past eight. Another problem - in the advertisement  was exactly written  some of the discounts of the tickets. No, alas in reality it appeared  a mistake. According to the advertisement, after the show anyone could go to the theatre restaurant for a drink. That appeared impossible, because the theatre restaurant was closed. The reason was unknown. That wasn't enough yet. At the end of the advertisement as I noticed it was said something of  perfect evening out. It wasn't truth. That's why I write my letter to you and I ask for my money back. I was expecting something really better. Mr manager, I warn you, if I don't get my money back, we'll meet at the court. Yours faitully  [SEP]  I believe, living in a modern country, that science and technology affected any aspect of my daily life. Looking back in the past, I can see, how big  difference  is between  life of my grandparents and mine. People living in the past couldn't travel so far as we could now and couldn't express the news around the world as we do it now, at present days. They could not communicate with someone living in other country, often located far away from his own. Using mobile phones, e-mails or  internet, we have a better access to a lot of different news. So, we are in  better situation now. But there are some drawbacks, which appeared  last years. For example a lot of pollution has raised. We now breathe worse air in our lungs, then our grand-parents breathed. I think, we are more addicted to do some things, which are not concerned with human nature. For example, people are addicted today to watch TV or often using the mobile phones. I don't really mind them. But I think and strongly believe, that we are the part of wildlife. And the modern technology that we use in our everyday life might not only help us, but determinly might destroy us. ",28.0
855," Hello, I'm so glad I won this prize, but I have some questions for you, and of course, the answers you asked me . Well, at first, I would like to travel only in July, because it's my holidays here in Portugal. And if it's possible I would like to go after day 10th, because I've got some things to do. And for me, I think  tents would be better, I don't know why but, I feel more comfortable. I think it's because the last time I travelled (with my friends), we stayed at log cabins, and when I was sleeping  felt some thing moving in my skin, then I work up frightened and when I openned my eyes, I saw lots of big ants! After that day, I've never stayed at a log cabin. Yeah, I think that's why! About activities, I enjoy most painting, because I am a plastic artist since I was nine and I've won lots of prizes with my art. And the other activity is singing. Everybody says I have an excellent voice, I like to sing when I painting too, it's so relaxing. Is that enough? I would like to ask what kind of clothe I probably will use there? And how much clothe? A lot, or  few? And what about money? Will I spend much? If you could tell me about this, I'll be glad! Greatefully Teresa J. Pereira  [SEP]  Dear Tina, You won't believe what I'm going to tell you! Remember when I told you I helped someone important? Well, listen to this. I was walking down the main street looking for a gift shop. (I had to buy something for a friend, it was his birthday) when I found a beautiful store, I stopped in front of it and start looking at the window  (outside), then I thought  interesting and came in. Suddenly, I saw a man with a cap covering his face. I tried to look again to see him better, because he seemed to be very handsome. And then he said ""if you promise me you won't get out of this store shouting and screaming and telling everyone that I'm here, I take this cap off of my face"". I didn't know what to do, I was sure he was a Robber, or even a murther! Then I said ""OK, I promise!"" (frightened, of course). Carefully, he took off the cap. Tina, guess WHO was he? Ricky Martin!! Can you believe it! And there's more! He asked me if I could help at his concert here in São Rafael. Because the store manager told him that I was the best hairdresser in the city! And his hairdresser was sick, so he and his producers were looking for one. Isn't that amazing? I met all the staff, and Ricky took lots of fotographs with me and gave me an autographied Record. Tina, I'm the luckiest girl in the world, don't you think? I'll send you some photos. Love, Teresa. ",33.0
729," 13th June 2000 Dear Ms Helen Ryan Competition Organiser I have just recieved the letter, which lets me know that I have won the first prize. I am proud of winning it and would like to say how thankful I am. I am therefore writing to give you my further information. First of all, I am a student and would like to travel in July. Because I intend to take  examination in Septenber. So I can afford to go on holiday only in July. Secondly, I would prefer to stay at log cabins rather than tents. It will be my first time to experience to stay there and I am interested in trying new things which I have not tried. The next consideration is the activities. Actually, I used to play basketball for 6 years and am quite confident of it. And nowadays, I have been practicing tennis as  school activity. Therefore I would like to choose basketball and tennis. Finally, I am considering about what kind of clothes I should wear and how much I need. I would be most grateful if you could give me further advicable information. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Kim, Hello! I hope everything around you is alright. You might not believe  but actually I helped at a pop concert last month and I really enjoyed it so much. So I'm now writing to let you know how grateful it was. All  work I needed to do wasn't very interesting. which I must have set thousands  chairs correctly and after finishing I put them back nicely. The reason I enjoyed it very much is that I could meet the vocalist on setting chairs just before they started practicing. I was asked if I wanted to sit down in front of  stage. Naturally I agreed and I could enjoy their gig as  audience. It was absolutely fantastic. I had ever never sit down there. Additionally, you couldn't believe , but the vocalist said ""All the chairs you are sitting down  were set  from him,"" pointing at me!! Actually I was a bit ashamed but it will be my brilliant memory. Anyway it was so interesting  time that I didn't even feel tired after that. Finally, I suggest you should try as I did if you have any opportunity. You must like it. I'm looking forward to seeing you soon. Can you send me the letter back writing what happend to you recently.

800," I have just received your letter and, firstly, I would like to thank you about  good news. I will give you the information which you asked me  in your letter and also  will ask you some questions. As I understand  is very imortant to confirm the date of  travelling. I would rather choose July because it is  only one month when I have got holiday, long enough to spend it by travelling abroad. Now about accomodation. If it is possible I would prefer to stay in  tent. As I am young I would like to be a romantic person and to be closer to the nature. I think it will be the best way to understand what California means. Ansering to your question about activities, I am going to choose tennis and swimming. I am quite good in tennis, especially plaing in two pairs. Also I like swimming and I've got two year experience in teaching swimming in  lesure centre. Could I ask you some questions about clothes and money. Should I take some clothes for  cold weather? The last question - could you tell me some idea about how much money could I need. Your sincerely  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable. As a women, as a mother and, finally, as an ordinary person, I am doing shopping quite often. Do I enjoy it? If I told you ""yes"" or ""no"", I'd tell you nothing. Shopping is part of my life. Sometimes I hate it. I can't be concentrate in a shop, but I can't relaxe as well. I am looking on the shelfs but I'm not able to find anything from my shopping list. Everybody are pushing me and I think that I came in a wrong place. On the other hand, I understand very well that it is really nesseceraly. I also understand that nobody will do that at my place. However, everybody in my family will open their mouths and won't just ask to eat, they will ask me  something special and testy. To be honest, sometimes I like shopping. I think it is an opportunity to meet different people (even if they are pushing you), to understand what they like and what they don't, because even some kind of food could be in fashing. When I am with my children I can lean them reading, counting, if they only don't run away from me to educate themself in the huge world,  which name is ""shopping"". ",28.0
1038," Dear Mr. Robertson, Thank you very much for your programme but we have another plan  to go to the London Fashion and Leisure Show which unluckily  on the same day as the day we would visit the Science Museum so we would like you to change the plan a little. Your programme is very good, especially that we can go to visit the Science Museum which I heard is very good but a visit to the London Fashion and Leisure Show would be a good opportunity for us to see the lastest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and hair styles and it is free for students too. So we think we should change your programme by going to the Science Museum on Wednesday afternoon and to do the shopping after the show. Thank you very much and we look forward to hearing from you.

If I hadn't borrowed it from him, I wouldn't have been here. No, it wasn't the time to regret , just get it and it would be all over. I stressed my arm, the branch I was standing on broke and I fell down on my leg. It was very hurt, my friend rushed to me than ran back to my house and called Mom. I can't remember anything else until I woke up at a hospital, lying on a bed with my leg in plaster. The nurse sitting beside me said to me, 'Your mother would like to have a word with you,' then she went out. Mom came in, looking very angry, I prayed for a short conversation. ",28.00
107," Dear Sir/Madam I am writing to you to complaint about the problem that happened in the play called ""Over the rainbow"", and for this reason I would like to get some money back. The problem is that most part of the advertistment had mistakes. First of all, there were not discount on  tickets' price, and it was advertised. Secondly, the play was advertised  at 19.30, but it started at 20:15. Despite of this fact, that I did not care about it at the beginning, when the play started I did not see Danny Brook, who is my favourite actor, I saw another actor who was not Danny Brook. Besides when I went to the restaurant it was closed, and I could not see it. But the main reason of my complaint, is that in the advertistment  said it would be my perfect evening out, and it was not. Therefore for all things I would be happy to get some money back. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed my daily life The technology has affected so much my daily life. If I had not it, I could not do most part of the things that I do today. First of all, if I had not it, I would not be able to move out of my city because I would not have  car. But we have it, and the thing that have changed more my life has been the internet. Nowadays with my computer, I can travel everywhere in the world, just with it connected with a modem. internet have changed my life because with it, we can do everything at home. For example if someday I forgot the book, with the internet I can find the book inside it, and more information . Another thing apart from the internet and the car that has changed my life is the TV. With the TV I can know all the information at the moment, moreover I can see films throw it. And the best thing is that it entertaints me alone or with people. In conclusion I think that without the technology we could not live as good as we live know, and our lives would be so much boring. ",21.0

We chose the Palace Hotel because it's near our college, too. So you are going to come at the conference in some minutes. When you go out of the Hotel turn right and go stright on, at the first crossroads turn right again. At the end of this street you can see our college on your left, it's a green building. At the end-of-conference party it'll be something to eat and to drink. In the big room where we'll have the party, it'll be some picturs of our college, you'll see al the generations who passed  here. The wears aren't very important, but it'll be fine if the people will wear something different from the usual jeans. Here we have a lot of beautiful things to do, but the best you can do in about three hours is visiting the painting museum. We all are looking forward to seeing your group. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  TELEVISION What would our world be without television? It isn't easy giving an answer at this question. Television is an important invention, it permitted us to better our way of communication. This animated box can give us a lot of informations coming from all around the world. Television has affected the ""all days life,,, too. We can spend a lot of time enjoying ourselves with some programs, all what we have to do is watching. And we like that, because it's easier nothing doing than engaging ourselves in something that make us do something. So television can be a positive or a negative invention, it depends on which use we want to do of this box. Now we should be able to answer at the introducing question. No, I don't think so. Television has become so important for us that we can't thinking that it couldn't exist. ",23.00

That is really the only time I have, unfortunately. I would love it if I could be accommodated in a tent. I'm looking forward to learning how to take care of myself in dangerous situations, such as getting lost in a forest, and I think being in a tent will be very usefull for that. I'd also like to get in touch with nature, and that is a great way . About the activities listed on your letter, I choose basketball and singing. I have played basketball for six years, and I've  in competitions for five years. I have good singing skills too. I have sung in the church's choir for three years, and I have had singing classes at school since first grade. I have recorded a demo tape, which I can send to you if you will, in which I also play the guitar. I would like to know how cold it is up there, for me to know what kind of clothes I should bring. Yours truthfully Benedito Alencar  [SEP]  Dear Kim, There was a huge Madonna show in a soccer stadium here in São Paulo. The most amazing thing is that I helped on it! I helped  setting up the sound equipment, programming the light system on the computer,  tidy up Madonna's room! I helped with the selling of the tickets, with the security, with the designing... But the unpredicted  was that I actually got to meet Maddy, and talk to her for almost one hour! The Material girl's the sweetest person in the world, totally unlike  the media says . Mo' told me everything about her new album, ""Music"", and how the single with the same name had slipped into the Internet in the UP3 format. She sang to me part of the album's second single, ""How it feels like for a girl""! Her daughter, Lourdes Maria, is such a pretty little girl, that I couldn't take my eyes off of her. Her boyfriend, Guy Richie, was there too, and he's a really good person. This is something I will never ever foget. The show after was great. I couldn't believe that I had met that superstar that was dancing in front of a crouded soccer stadium. Hope you enjoy the pictures,  got one autograph for you. Yours faithfully, Benedito. ",36.0

First of all I would like to thank you for making such a good plan, for us, so we could have a good time. Then I would like to explain to you about The London Fashion and Leisure Show. Finally  how the programme could be changed. The London Fashion And Leisure Show is taking place in  Central Exhibition Hall in London and happens on Tuesday March 14. From ten o'clock in the morning till seven o'clock in the afternoon. The reason that I suggest that we go is that it is a great opportunity because we can see the latest fashions,  leisure and sports wear as well as make up and different hairstyles. In addition to these we will not have to pay anything since it is free for students. I suggest that we should transfer our visit to the Science Museum on Wednesday afternoon in our free time that we have. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  It was dangerous, but I had to do it. I did not have any choice since my brother was in trouble. I had to become a burgler again and steal jewelry from the jewelry shop near by. As I knew the teknics to break in a place without being noticed, I should not be afraid but tonight I had to steal the most precious diamond in the country which was very well secured. When I got close to the shop, I checked if anyone was around and luckily was not. Then I approached slowly the door, broke the lock and opened the door. However, my adventure was not over yet. There were laisers all over the place, with which I had to be careful with. Suddenly something went wrong, the alarm was making  noise. I ran towards the diamond grabed it got out quickly,  ran out of the back door. By surprise I saw a car waiting for me outside. I got into the car  gave the jewelry in exchange of my brother, took him and left the place. ",26.00
317," Sir/Madam, I am writting this letter to inform you I had a very disappointing evening during your musical show ""Over the rainbow"" at the Circle Theatre where you are the director. First of all, the actor was expected to be Danny Brook. He is my favourite actor and the most important reason I went to your theatre. But finally, without telling us anything, there was a different actor. This was very disappointing. Secondly, your famous restaurant was closed. That was very displeasured because I had planned a romantic dinner with my wife. If you had told me your restaurant was going to be closed, I would have made a reservation anywhere else, but you didn't. And finally the play started with a delay of forty-five minutes and there were not discounts available. Both things do not agree with what I read on your advertising sign. Due to all of these reasons, I hope you could give  my money back. Yours sincerely, MANUEL ALMODAR  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. But I didn't know that when I told her I was thinking in going away from home. This was a very difficult decission but I had to take it because of my personal situation, all the time shouting and fighting will all my family. Therefore my girlfriend lived alone so I could have stayed with her or just have gone on travelling around the world. I was thinking a lot about this problem and how to solve it so I needed someone to talk to and Pat had always been my best friend. But it was a big mistake because she told it to her mother and I don't know how but now my mother know  it, and she is very worried about me and my future. And my father thinks a year travelling and living by myself will be very good for me. Finally, my parents are all the time argueing about differents solutions to my problem, and this all thanks to Pat. ",34.0
54," Dear Jane Clark I am writing to tell you about the festival in this time and I would like to suggest  you three things for  next festival. First of all, it is  great idea to have a this kind of festival. I enjoyed it so much. But, there are three things which I would like to tell you. Firstly. There were stars and artists from only six countries. I supposed to see quite various nationality. Secondly, I actually liked  Jazz, rock and classical concerts very much. However, some concert halls were too small for the many people so we couldn't have a enough space. thirdly. I would like to you to consider about having more plays and films next year. It would be nicer. Otherwise, the price was really reasonable for all :events the weekend. I was satisfied with that. And if there was musical event. It would be greatful. I hope the next one will be better. And I would like to thank you about making this festival. I look forward to  next festival very much. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Lula Hello. How are you doing? I hope you're well. It's nice to hear about your class. It's quite interesting. Let me tell you some rules at school in my country. Actually. We have quite strict rules. When I was a student, I wasn't allowed to wear any fashionable clothes. Only It was like a formal clothes. And we couldn't wear any colorful clothes and socks. Also our hair style was the same as everyone. It's really strict. At home. There is one thing I'd like to change. I'm not allowed to sleep at my friend's house. I really like chatting all night with my friends. But I can't  it. I'm pursuading my mum, perhaps. The school rules in my country are more strict than  your country. Anyway. If you want to know about something of our country. I'm glad to tell you more. I'm looking forward to getting your letter soon. Thank you. Take care of yourself. Loves, ",23.00
359," 17 June 2000 Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to complain about a musical show on  10 of June, and I was very disappinted. I was promised that the starring was Danny Brock but when I was there I saw just other starring that was completely difference from  your brochar. To make the matter worse, I was travelling to London to see this famous starring but I didn't see any shows of them. It make me a bit angry. According in your brochour, it was started to show at 19.30 p.m. but it was started at 20.15 p.m. I wanted to sleep and  very anoying. More than that, when I bought the ticket I didn't get any discounts. I had to pay full prise. I was promised that after  show I could go to  theatre restaurant but due to  started late we aslo finished late therefore, when I went to the restaurant they were deffinately closed. I was very hungry and tired. You said that it was a perfect evening out but it wasn't like that. I would like  to refund some  money back. I paid for the show £ 50.00 I also have a recite to prove it. I would like you to give my money back as soon as possible. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully, Phukana Najee  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. I have a really good, freind, Pat who I was trusted and counted on her. I have know her for five years. and we were love each other very much. One day, I was falling in love with  closest freind. I went out with him sometimes and we were happy. My boy freind was very handsome, clever and very polite. We were stedy at the same class at school and he also knowed Pat as well. Personally, I wanted to keep  serets because I  afraid that we might have splited up. And I would like to make sure that he was relly love me. My boy freind told me that he wanted to surprise his freind in his class when the times comes. To be honest, I wanted to share this felling to someone else but I needed to keep  very secret. I felt unhappy sometimes. One day I decided to tell my best freind - Pat who I realio-on her. I told her everything abat my boyfreind and when we were met each other and evertauly we were falling in love. After I told her I felt my feeling had been released and I was happy. I also told her to keep  very secret didn't tell anyone in the class. On Monday morning, I walked into the class and all of my freind was shouting at me and called my name and  my boyfreind. I was absolutely ambaressed and I wanted to ran out of the class. I felt very angry to Pat and I shouldn't have told her about my boy friend. I felt regret but  too late it wasn't  secret any more now. ",23.0
1122," Dear Mr Robertson, We would like to thank you for all the time you have spend for us in order to organize the programme that we should follow during  three days that we are going to spending  London. We all believe that  is a great programme which concludes both education and free time. We would like to inform you that we notice an advertisement for the London fashion and Leisure Show. This show is going to take place in the Central Exhibition Hall of London on Tuesday, March 14 between the hours 10.00-19.00, and we would like to ask you if it is possible to go to that show. We think that  is a great opportunity and we are all very interesting  to go because we can see there the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, lot  kinds of make up and some of the famous hairstylers. The show is absolutly free for students. As a class we suggest to go to this show on Tuesday, March 14  morning and to visit the Science Museum on Wednesday afternoon during our free time. If that of course is possible. We  all like to thank you again.  [SEP]  In the year 2000  media is one of the most powerful things on the planet. The media is everywhere, televisions, radio stations, newspapers,  magazines all have one goal, to inform the citizens. Some of them, however are not doing their job probably. They don't inform people about news, education or documentaries. They just published gossips about famous people, such as politicians, musicians and film stars. I believe all the people famous or not, deserve to have  private life without journalists to following them all the time. They are humans like all of us with their problems, their good and bad times and of course they don't want to be publish them in front of millions of people because a journalist thought that this is right. And good for his pocket. I think the only way of change that is, the people, If the people shows no interest  the journalist would have no goal of publish any gossips because  is not going to be watch or read by anyone. So the power is to the people. ",29.00
1014," Dear Mr Robertson, On behalf of our class I would like to give you some information about the London Fashion and Leisure show, that we saw advertised and we are interested  indeed. In addition we would like to thank you about the programme. Firstly, I would like to give you some details about this show. It will take place in  Central Exhibition Hall, in London, on Tuesday  14th of March and the suitable time will be 10.00 - 19.00 I would like to mention that  this day we are going to visit the Science Museum in the morning and after we are going for shopping, so I believe it will be a good change for all of us to attend this show as it is free for students! The most important thing is that the time that the show starts is perfect and is suitable as well with our programme because until 19:00 I think that everyone will have finished their shopping. Secondly, I would like to give you more details about the show and particularly  what does it include. The latest fashion will be on show and also the Leisure and sports wear. Really interesting! Moreover all about the make up and the hairstyles. I think that it will be a great opportunity to all of us to be on this show while we are going to be in London. But, if there is a problem that the show is on Tuesday afternoon, the same hour with shopping, I suggest having the shopping on Wednesday afternoon that we will not have anything to do! I look forward to your reply, Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Some people think that to be a famous person is  very excuiting thing, that all the time this makes you feel completely and also they think that if you are famous you are special as well. I believe, that if somebody wants the fame and the glory  must be tottally sure about the results. For example, the politicians the have choosed their careers, they must know that they are going to involved with everything that it has to do with publicity and their country and the most important  is that they have to realize that they should be extremely careful of their movements or else they are going to have  bad reputation, and they will be not  trustworthy. Another succesfull carreer such as, film stars must also be balanced. If somebody is a film star this mean that  has got a different kind of life,  more comfortable, more interesting  but it doesn't mean that he or she can't be like normal people even if he or she is a star. If somebody wants to be famous of cource  must be on the top and the mass media will be following him or her. But I think that the are limits. Everybody deserve to have a private life even if he is a plumber or even if she is a famous singer. It doesn't matter what kind of carreer or job you are follow. You must control your behaviour and try not implove so much yourself. And finally the journalists the should know how to respect the private life of everyone and not trying to make money for a living by using the reputation of the famous people. ",23.00
264," Dear Sir/MADAME, I am writting  you because yesterday I went to the musical show ""Over the Rainbow"" and I had a bad evening. First of all, in the advertisement  says that the starring were different actors, and there weren't different one, so that can not be. Also in the advertisement  says, that the show will begin at 19.30 and it started at 20.15; that mean that I have to cancelled a date that I had at 21:00, because I coudn't make it. If you present a show you must be on time. Another thing that happened was that the tickets did not have discount and the advertisement says the will have. So, how is  possible that you present an advertisement and you don't make what it say? Finally, it supose to have the restaurant open, and it wasn't, because they didn't have electricity to cook, so they close it. I am really made and I want my money back, please call me to the number 23456789, I will be waiting  your call. Thank  for your time your sincerelly  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed your daily life? Modern technology have change my daily life in many aspects. First of all at work; computer are really amazing, you only need to turn it on and start to write; your work is more clean and you work faster. Also change my free time, they had invented great games like play station, and you can have a really good time with your friend playing. In the early day, on a raining day you couldn't play because most of game were  outside the house but now with the technology you can make many things in your house. Another aspect is , on the house artefacts, microwaves, laundrymachine, make life easily. In my opinion technology have made human life easily, funier and more comfortable. ",22.0
1057," Dear Mr Robertson, At first, all the students and I would thank  you for this great idea of a trip in London during three days. The programme is very exating and interesting, especially the river trip to Greenwich. Otherwise, all the class have seen an advertisement for the ""London Fashion and Leisure Show"", and we are all interested  to see this show, this is why I am writing to you. In fact this is a great opportunity because we certainly will not have again the chance to take part in a live show, like this one. Even more, the students don't pay the entrance. The show is on the 14th from 10.00 to 19.00, so I suggest to go to the Science Museum on the afternoon of Wednesday, and just have two or three hours free time after the museum. This is the arrangement that we fouded with the other students and everyone had agree. I look forward to hear  news from you. Your Faithfull,  [SEP]  It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. The survive of my family depended on me. We were a poor family, living in one room for five persons. My father died during the war and my mother stayed alone with four children. We haven't enough money to buy food,  new clothes and the worse  was that my youngerst brother was terribly ill, and without money we couldn't bring him up to a doctor. So, a day I decided to steal the bank. During weeks, I had prepared my programme, trying not to forget something important. Everything was ready and me  too. So I knew that the day after would be the good one. I get up very early. All the city was sleeping. The weather was cold. When I arrived in front of the bank, my heart was going faster. A few days before, I had founded a little window at the back of the building, so I entered by this way and by chance I just arrived in the monney's room. I hadn't never seen so much money. I took it, the most of possible and went out by the same way. I ran to my house and went back in my bed for sleep a little bit. When all the family get up, I told us the true and  all promised to say nothing. It was our family's secret. ",24.00
117," JUN 17th, 2000 Dear MR SMITH, My name is Volencia Vardez. I am writing to complain about the services that you are offering during the shows at your theatre. Last May, I had a week holiday in London, and during my trip I decided to buy tickets for OVER THE RAINBOW, the MUSICAL SHOW. I was really excited with the idea of seeing that show. First of all, when I arrived, I met a note stuck on the front door that informed  about changes at  actor's staff. Danny Brook was ill. He was replaced by another actor whose abilities were bad. Secondly, I want to tell you that the show started forty five minutes later. In order to the tickets, I want to say that they are very expensive. I had put some money aside for a month, thinking about the discount, but when I want to buy them they said that discounts were not avaible. To sum up, the restaurant was closed. I will appreciate  if you could send me my money back. Looking for your repley. Yours Faithfully.  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat was not very good at keeping secrets. That is why she could no be a spy. When she was a girl, Pat used to play spies and detectives games. Her mother gave  a book about how to become a spy for her birthday. She had watched all  Mission Impossible and gadget, the inspector series. When she finished the school, she went to study to the Agent Trainning Agency where she learnt about guns, clues, agencies, etc. She was the best student they have ever had. But things changed during her first mission. She was sended to New York to discover how some people from  government gave money to the merchants because they want to build a Trade Center there. At first she walked around the bayside market looking for all the people who were there. When she saw a man, different for the rest, talking with one of the sellers. Immediately she interrupted and told to the man that she was a secret agent. Obviously the man realised that she was looking for him and said that she was really crazy! You can imagine what had happened with her cover as a spy. ",26.0
920," Dear Mrs. Ryan Thank you for your letter which I have just received this morning. I am really appreciated to hear that I have won first prize in the competition - two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. I am writing this letter to inform you more information about myself. I would like to travel only in July because I will have a summer holiday for 2 months at that time. I would prefer the accommodation at Camp California in tents because it would be nice to spend the time living in tents with a nice environment and fresh air. Also I would like to do two activities while I am at the Camp which are swimming and photography. Photography is quite interesting for me to take a photograph in the place where I have never been to . Swimming is quite  nice activity to relax and work out. It is really enjoyable to keep my body fit and healthy by swimming. Anyway, I would like to know that how many people are joining at this Camp. Could you please tell me about the clothes I should take? I am looking forward to hearing from you as soon as possible. Yours sincerely Boonsri Thanasukolwit.  [SEP]  Dear Kim Thanks for your last letter. I'm really sorry, it's taken me so long to reply. How are you doing? I hope that you can get on well with your roommate. Anyway, I enjoyed helping at a pop concert last month. I and my friend - Emma, we helped to paint the scence of the background on the stage. As you known, I like drawing and painting when I have a free time so that  why I chose to paint the scence of the background. I really enjoyed painting it and it looked very nice. And I particularly liked the experience that I helped to screen and paint a picture of ""Bon Jovi"" on every T-shirts which are given to the audiences. I felt that it was a great time in my life. However, I told my teacher that I am willing to give a hand next time. Are you willing to give a hand next time? If you are, I'll tell you  in advance. I must stop writing now as I have a lot of homework to do. Best wishes ",33.0
667," Dear the competition organiser (Helen Ryan) I'm as happy to heard that I have won the first prize. Here is the information you want from me.  Firstly, I can only go in July. Because I'm in the holiday  that moment. I think I would prefer the accommodation at Camp California is in tents. Because it is more safety, and I don't like to be in the log cabins. The activities are quite hard to choose really, because you have a lot of chose which is I like. But I think I will choose Basketball and Photography, because basketball is the only sport I can play well. Photography is a very interesting activitie, and is not too hard to do too. Here  have some questions which I would like to ask, what kind of clothes sould I need? How much did I need for the Camp? Finally I hope the information I've gave are useful for you, and hope you can answers my questions A.S.A.P. Yours Sincerely  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable  Shopping, for most the people it is very important because you need to get the stuff you need or you want. For some people it may be a method to relax themselves, after you have been to work or school. So it is a thing you will enjoy most of the time, but still have something you will not enjoy it. It depends on what is the place and the aim you are shopping. For example some people always shopping to get food or stuff the need in everyday life, they won't enjoy this kind of shopping, because it is not getting what they want. The place where you are shopping  also very important. For example in HK all the areas have lots of people it won't let you feel good of the noise and times when you are shopping. Because have too many people it make you want to stay home  won't enjoy shopping. After I've written this composition, I think that you will enjoy shopping most of the time, but still have sometimes you won't. ",24.0
707," Dear Helen Ryan Thank you very much for your letter. I was very glad to hear that I had won first prize in the competition. Anyway, to participate in two-weeks  Camp California in the U.S.A I readily give you my personal details and information. First of all, the most favorable time for me to travel is July, because I am in the final year of University, so I have to attend classes for a thesis almost throughout the year apart from July, when I can take a relatively long summer holiday. Second of all, I would prefer to stay in log cabins to staying in tents, since I have had a horrible experience being attaked by a herd of midges, when I camped out. Additionally, I am very happy to be given the chance to do some activities during the stay. I would willingly like to choose swimming and painting. I used to belong to a swimming club and practise swimming a couple of times a week. I have also gone in for some competitions. Painting is one of my hobbies as well, although I do not specialise in it or anything. I'm looking forward to painting beautiful landscapes of California. Last but not at least, what sort of clothes do you think I must bring with me, and is there any laundry system there? Also should I take some money just in case? I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon, and I would be very grateful for your help. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Introduction The aim of this report is to describe and assess daily life at this school and suggest which lessons and other activities should be filmed. This is based on a questionnair conducted in the school and our English department's investigation. Lessons According to statistics based on the questionnair, the majority of students feel the most enthusiasm for an English class. This may be thanks to native speaker teachers who came to the school last year. In fact, I visited some Englishe classes to find out that most students tried to answer questions and speak to native teachers. Furthermore less numbers of students were nodding off comparing with other classes like Maths. Consequently it might be a good idea to film the English class so that the vibrant and active atomosphere may be able to be filmed. This may also contribute to the promotion of  English department. Extra activities It was found that hockey is the most popular sport among students. As the record says, our hockey team has been on the top of the league for three successive years. The girls' football team is also famous for its reputation of keeness on practice. Although every school has a boys' football team, our school is the only one which possesses a girls' team. Team members can be interviewed. Conclusion To sum up, our school is famous for achievements in several fields as well as academic achievements. The whole point of making a video is to tell people that we are not only bugs of books but also enjoying our school life. It might also be a good idea to film our computing rooms and sports facilities that we can be proud of. ",37.0
721," June 13th, 2000 Dear Mrs. Ryan, First of all thank you very much for the good news that I have won the first price in your competition. I am very delighted and already looking forward to spending two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A.. As regards the time that I can travel I must tell you that my holidays at university are only in July. I hope that it wouldn't be a problem for you and that I can go to the Camp California at some time in July. I would like to stay in a log cabin as I have an allergie against grass. Then you asked  to chose two activities from the list you sent to me. I would like to do surfing and photography. I am a total beginner in both activities, but I think that these two weeks will be a good opportunity to learn something about them. Finally I have also some questions to you. Firstly I would like to know what kind of clothes will be appropriate for the camp, secondly how much money I should take with me for the two weeks and lastly if there are any possibilies for cooking. yours sincerely,  [SEP]  'Shopping is not always enjoyable' If you have to go shopping again, because the fridge is empty or you need some new clothes, a lot of time, patience and straingth are needed. All kinds of shopping have more and more become to a rather stressful activity than an enjoyable on. I often begins with finding a parking for the car, which can take more than 15 minutes. Leaving the car at home is also not a good ideas  you often buy so much that you can't carry it in plastic-bags. The next stressful factor begins in the shop: Everywhere people who are in a hurry and push you from one side to the other. Consuming has become a very important thing for them. And if you are not quick enough they won't leave  anything left. But there occure also problems if there are products left: either you can't decide between two things or your favourite product is too expensive. Having finally decided and got what you wanted to, the next torture comes at the cash-desk, when you have to pay. You have to wait at a long queue for more than 15 minutes. So even if it's nice to have food or new clothes at home, without patience, time and straingth you should better stay at home or try to find the most convenient time for shopping. ",31.0
227," 17.6.2000 Dear Sir, I am writing for explaining some problems your theatre has got and asking for some money back. I saw your advertisement and I expected a discounted ticket for students. But in a ticket office I realised I couldn't get it. Another problem was the time. The play was supposed to start at 19.30 but it was delayed so at 20.15 a curtain of the stage was pulled up. As soon as the play had started I noticed another problem. I am a big fan of Danny Book and it was why I chose 'over the rainbow'. When I saw a different actor playing his role I was really disappointed. Las problem I would like to tell you  is  a restaraunt there. After the show I went to the restaurant according to your advertisement but it was closed because of decoration. When I booked the ticket I really expected the show. Unlike my expectation it was so disappointing and annoying. So I would like to ask for some money back. I am looking forward to hearing from you soon. Yours faithfully, TA HYUN PHAT  [SEP]  I remember some sientific cartoons when I was younger I watched on television. They describe the future world where people would travel to the moon. But it is coming true now. Modern technology has been changing even my daily life in positive and negative ways at the same time. First it helps  my social life to be convinient. I have got my own computer so it is easy for me to send e-mails to my friends very often. Second I can save time. If there was no public transport like  underground in a big city I couldn't imagine travelling on time. On the other hand, modern technology could affect my life in a bad way. Because of computeres or telephones I could have less chances to meet my friends than before. It could make my emotions fade. Another problem is pollution. I think a car is one of the most common products of modern technology. The more cars there are on the street, the more difficult it is for me to keep myself fit. To sum it up, as technology is improving my life itself is becoming convinient. In spite of its good sides I think my life could get worse. To live in this world needs somebody else to contact and health. But I am loosing chances to meet my friend face to face and I feel I am getting weaker. I suppose people including me should keep themselves in a limited their own space in near future. It will be caused by technology. ",32.0
402," Dear Sir/Madam: I am writing to ask about your advertisement and theatre show. I am a student in Liverpool, and recently I had a week's holiday in London. First day in London, I saw your advertisement which was very interesting to me. But I was really disappointed  it. First of all, there was only one actor that was different from your advertisement. Also, it was certain to me  to bought a discount tickets cause I am a student. But, it was not availiable. Second, I went to the theatre  exactly seven thirty in the evening. However the show started 45 minutes later. I wasted time too much for waiting. It was not good to me, cause I had only one week holiday in London. Moreover the theatre restaurant was closed with the word ""Stuff vacation"" on the front door after the show. It was absolutely different from your leaflet. On the whole, I was really disappointed at that time. Could you do me my half of money back. I enclose my phone number and address. I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon. Yours faithfully Lo Son Lin.   [SEP]  Fashion of the Future. Have you ever seen the film star wars? And did you notice something about fashion of the future? I think the people will wear convenient clothes with  simple design in the future. Because the people will stay at home more than now with their computer. And they will use soft cozy cloths like cotton and silk. However, if they have some special day when like  important public day or special day of their life, they will wear very different kinds of clothes which was you  never seen before. Some of that will be very strange to our eyes, but some of  others will be familiar to us. And they will use the most kinds of things like small stone to diamond etc. Maybe some peoples are nakid. It will be very interesting... Just imagine the way of future people's life. And you can see the their clothes also.  ",21.0
184," Dear Sir, The reason for which I decided to write you a letter, will, I guess, surprise you. I hope you will not feel offensed, but I really needed to contest about your theater. I was present at your musical show: ""Over the rainbow"". It was very excited thinking about being at the theatre, and I though with certainty I was going to enjoy my evening. Plus, I felt very pleased when I heard that Danny Brook was part of the play: he used to be an old friend of mine in Highschool and perchance I have found him back here! You can believe I was very disappointed when I saw that he actually was not playing and I was more bewildered that noone made an apologie for it! How rude! Moreover; it was written that the show was supposed to start at 19.30; it actually started at exactly 20.15! 45 minutes latter: where we had nothing to do, but waiting. We couldn't even have a drink, because, obviously, the restaurant you talked about was closed! Really, what a mess in the administration. Although, I would have felt better if I had had a discount on my ticket, as you mentionned in the advertisement, but unfortunately, these couldn't possibly be reached either! I am sure you are smart enough to think of paying me back, so you do not lose a faithful client. Sincerely yours,  [SEP]  If more and more ingenors work on science and technology, it must be that it is really usefull: but in what particular way? For my part, I know it would be such a pain in my neck. The more I think of it, the more I realise I use modern technology a lot. I guess I could not live without many instruments. The first  I think of is  internet. What a great invention! It allows me to learn anything without having to travel through many libraries as I used to do. It also makes me write to my friends by e-mail. I did not to write at all to people until I have got   internet. By this procedure, you only type and send, no need to going to the post-office! Of course this is just because I am lazy, I actually could force me a little, and then go to the library and to the post-office, but  internet just makes it easier! I am also very fond of cell-phones. These are also such a relief. I can go anywhere without being nervous about the fact, that maybe someone is trying to reach me! Modern technology changed my daily life by making it easier and by turning me into a lazy woman. Nevertheless, this easy life has then offered me  to be more peaceful and I think it is essential. Although I am thankful to modern technology! ",35.0
233," Dear sir, I'm writing to you, to complain about the musical show ""OVER THE RAINBOW"", that I came to see during my holiday in London, at your theatre. Unfortunately that evening wasn't as good as I expected. First of all in your advertisment for the show you wrote that Danny Brook and Tina Truelove were taking part at the show. And I was so excited about it! But I was very disappointed when I realised that another actor was taking  part. And the worst  was that he wasn't so good in his role! Another thing was that the show I went to was  starting at 19:30 but it started at 20:15! The people who were there to watch the show were very ungry and they were shouting because they  were waiting for too long, And I absolutely agree with them. Also in the advertisment you wrote that discounts were available, but they weren't, And also that people could visit the theatre restaurant after the show, to eat some thing or to have a drink. But when I went there, it was closed. I don't know why and I'd like you to tell me, the reason. Finally, you said that it would be our perfect evening out. Well it wasn't and I ask for my money back. I'd like you to return them to me. I'll wait to hear from you soon...  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. So, the next day Pat went and told to his sister Sally that her friends were organising a suprise party for her birthday. When Sally heared that,  was very suprised and very excited. But because she didn't want to disappoint her friends, she was acting as  she didn't know anything. She let them to organise it! But although she was acting like this she was very ungry with her brother Pat, because he didn't keep the secret. The party was on Saturday at Sally's house. All her friends were going to meet there, while she was at her swimming lesson. When that day arrived they all went there as they planned. When the clock showed 8:00 they hide themselves under the tables and the  furnitures. After a while the bell rang. It was Sally! Suddenly they all shouted ""suprise!"". Sally although she knew  it, she seemed very suprised! So her friends didn't understand that she knew about the party and they were very happy because they believed that the suprise party had   succeed! But although Sally knew about it, they had a really great time. They danced a lot and they had pizza for dinner. It was an unforgetable night!!! ",30.0
495," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing in order to express my extreme dissatisfaction with the musical show 'Over the Rainbow' that recently took place in The Circle Theatre. During my prior holiday in London I came across an encourageing advertisment for the show and decided to see it. Unfortunately, I was very dissappointed to find out that there were no discounts available! Therefore, it cost me more money then usual. In addition, I was very annoyed by the fact that the event had started at 20:15 - not 19:30 as mentioned in the advertisment. My dissatisfaction became even bigger when I had realize that there had been a different actor than Danny Brook performing! Moreover, I was unable to use the theatre restaurant as it had been closed due to redecoration! Having noticed that this was not 'a perfect evening out' I would like to ask for my money back. I feel as if I had been lied to and thus I demand my money to be returned. I am looking forward to receiving a response in the near future. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Everyone had already heard of me getting the secret access code for the 'Secret Society' organisation. This was the kind of association everybody knew of but nobody talked about. Everyone was aware that telling aloud about  'Secret Society' could get you in trouble, serious trouble. There had been cases when somebody entered the club but never came back afterwards. I guess it was that thrill that actually made me anxious to know what really was going on inside the dodgy-looking old house guarded by a man with an unfriendly hound. I've always enjoyed the hazard and this time getting the password was, indeed, a tough coockie. But knowing what these people are capable of makes me doubt wether to use it or not. Especially now, when 'big-mouth' Pat spread the news to litterally everyone. I wouldn't be surprised if suddenly something bad happened to me. Therefore, I have to escape. What I've learned from this situation is to never trust people again. You should remember about this in the future. ",32.0
638," 13th June 2000 Dear Mrs Ryan, I am satisfied to have received your letter that informed me that I have won the first prize in your competition. I am very happy to spend two weeks at Camp California, because I have never gone to  U.S.A. I would prefer to travel only in July, because I have not to work and because I would prefer to have accomodation in  tent and so I think that july is the best period to spend two weeks in  tent. I have just been  in  tent and I think it is always a beautiful and interested adventure. During the journey I would do surfing and photography. I like very much to be alone with nature and when I was a girl, I had gone to a surfing-course for five years and I won a lot of prizes. I like also doing photography because they can be memories IN my future. I would  receive further information about which kind of clothes I should put off during my holiday and I would  know if I should bring with me a lot of money. Looking forward to spending my holiday in the USA I wait  your letter. Your sincerelly Guillelmina Farina.  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I am afraid that I couldn't write  you immediatly, but last month I enjoyed helping at a pop concert and so I am very busy. Even if the job was so hard, it was an amused experience. I woke up at six a.m. and I worked until nine p.m. but it isn't a problem for me, because I like spending my time with other people. I particularly liked to know people of different countries and some pop-stars, which were friendly with us. I was surprised of the co-operation that there was during the job, because it was as a big family, where each member helped  others. There was a lot of work to do but we were happy to do it with glad people and at the end we had the possibility to take part in the pop concert. It was wonderful! Looking forward to meeting you as soon as possible. I greet you. Best wishes Guillelmina ",25.0
135," Dear Sir/Madam; Yesterday I went to the theatre play called ""Over the Rainbow""  which I saw the advertisement in todays Guardian. I want to tell you that I am very dissapointed about the play. In the advirtisement it is written that Danny Brook was in the starring . However I didn't see him all the night. There was another actor instead of him. And also it should be started at 19.30, as I saw in the advirtisement,  which has started at 20.15! And so far there wasn't any discounts available which is written to be ""available"" in the advirtisement. I went to the theatre restaurant after the show but it was closed because of the re-decoration progress inside. You should have written it in the advirtisement. And after all  no one can say that I had a perfect evening out! Absolutely it was very dissapointing. so I want my money back. I hope you understand me and correct your mistakes in the next advirtisement and send me my money soon! Yours Faithfully  [SEP]  Simple Solutions It is over 50 years since the production of the computer and television. Our lifes changed since then Today every 5 out of 10 pupil can use  computer basicly. And almost everybody has a television in their homes. These 2 devices make my life easier. I can't go out all the time or be with my friends to have fun. So I watch Tv at home instead of sitting in a chair looking out of a window. I play   computer more than watching Tv when I get bored. The internet is the world's largest communication system ever made. I can do anything I want such as buy Cd's watch  film or even buy food. It is really enjable when I chat with pupil.  Internet brought a new way to my live since I started to use it. It is easy and very useful. I can reach any knowledge that I want to. Techology is also important in one subject for me. Transportation. I can't have to walk to school everyday for 8 months, Cars, busses and trains are very useful in daily life. Lots of thing would be hard and boring in my life  I was living in a different time than now. I can easily do what I want. Technology brought simple solutions to my life. ",24.0

761," Dear Helen, I am very glad to hear from you that I have won the first prize in your competition. I would like to reply and ask you some questions. Firstly, I would be available for travelling only in July because my university will finish at the end of June and will start again in August. Secondly, for the accomodation, I would say I prefer living in  tent rather than in  log cabin because I used to sleep in  tent while I was joining  a local scout camp in my country. Thirdly, I have choosen Sailing and Photography from the list you gave me because both of them are my favorite hobbies and I have been enjoying Sailing and Photography for several years so I am quite good at both of them. Finally, I would  ask you whether I have to prepare any speacial clothes for camping or the camp will provide them for me. I look forward to receiving the details of  travelling soon and  joining your camp in July. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable. In my opinion, I do agree with this expression. One of the most unforgettable habit of city life is going out for shopping. I used to hang around famous cloth shops looking at the new arrival clothes section. It is not only a good fun to see the new fashions and things but  also decrease the  money in my pocket. Sometime shopping doesn't give anything to you but always waste all your free time. A group of girls can spend their time in a shopping center forever. It seems to me that more people in my hometown tend to go shopping in their free time because the shopping complexs nowadays are more attractive and combine every facilities inside. From my point of view, someone goes shopping just because he/she wants to show off that he/she is wealthy. Keeping  balance between daily life and shopping life may give more enjoyable rather than always walking in an air-conditioned shopping complex. ",39.0
976," Dear madame I'm very surprised about the good news and I'm sure I'll really have a good time in California. I'm happy to answer to your questions. First of all, I would like to travel in July because my boss won't let me free in August. Secondly, I would like to stay in  tents because I like camping a lot and I do it whenever I can. Regarding to the activities, I choose swimming and tennis. I'm a good swimmer and I would like to do it in the Californian See. I don't think I'll have the chance of doing it again in the future. On the contrary, I'm an absolute beginner in playing tennis and I'm not fit  in running but I chose it because it is a sport I've always wanted to learn BUT I'VE NEVER HAD enough free time. There is something I would like to ask you. What kind of clothes am I supposed to bring with me? And what about money? Should I bring cash or a credit card is all I will need? And what about sanitary precautions? I can't ?look forward to start this adventure. Yours sincerily Carla Reale  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable I'm a woman and they say that shopping is women's best activity. But I have a particular problem. I'm not slim and I'm a little ashamed of my body. That's why shopping is not an easy thing to do. In fact I can't buy whatever I like and I can't follow fashions just like the other women do. When I go shopping I always have to ask for the extra-large size and  harder to find it. I see a lot of pretty things but I have to quit the idea of wearing them just because I think that they won't look so pretty on me. And if this is a problem to me, imagine how bad a very fat woman (or man) should feel. Often they must go in special shops to by their clothes. It looks like a sort of racism and unfortunately our society looks for beauty. Just think about commercials. They're full of perfect people. The sort of people you will never find in real life. Will this ever change? I hope so, but, in the meantime, I'm on a diet. ",33.0
411," Saturday 17th June Dear Sir, I am writing to complain about your musical show. I am not really satisfied about it. Lots of information in your advertisement are not correct. Some problems of organisation seem to be appeared. Firstly, I hoped to have a relaxing entertainment with your musical show but it was not the case. In your advertisement you announced the actors were Danny Brook and Tina Truelove. They were replaced by less famous actors. Unfortunately, the musical show was annoying. I was terribly disappointed. Moreover, it started at 20.15 instead of 19.30 as you had written on it. I had to wait for 45 minutes without nothing doing. I would you informed us before. Secondly, furthermore I had to pay full price whereas you granted us some discount prices. I was very interested in visiting your theatre restaurant after the show but it seemed to me it was closed. Your assistant prevented us from visiting it because it was too late and he was so busy. Finally, you thought that you could grant us a perfect evening but it was not true. Consequently, I would like you refund my bill. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Nowadays, we need modern technology to improve on daily life. In my opinion, science and technology will have consequences on my behaviours. First of all, as you also know, lots of technology have boosted since  few years. For example, without using  internet I could not put me through to foreign people. This interactive way of communication allows me to reach everybody everywhere without restrictions. I feel free as a eagle. I can take advantage of those technologies as mobile phone, lap top computer, television, to have contacts with different cultures. Secondly, technology has changed my daily life because it allows me to do much more things than before. Unfortunately, it could have an inconvenient for me because of pollution from cars, factories. I can't go to the towncentre of  big city. There are links between the greenhouse, technology and me. To conclude, we must not forget that science and technology is a tool   to live better. Be carefull, my own technology can kill me. I can use it but with some limits. ",22.0
640," Dear Mrs. Ryan, I am writing this letter, concerning the information you have asked me to give you. First of all, I would like to thank you, for giving me the chance to visit Camp California. As far as I am concerned, my exams at school will have finished up to the middle of June. To be honest, I would like to spend some days with my family, before I go to California. Therefore, it would be better to go there in July. July should be the hotest month! The best season for holidays. About the accomodation, I would be pleased to stay in a tent, because this reminds me  the holidays with my family. According on the table with the activities, I will choose singing and swimming because I am a very good swimmer and  very fanatic singer from  very young . I joined my choir, when I was eight years old and I have sung solo in two concerts. I would be grateful  to tell me how much money I will need with me. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I am really impressed from your interest about my experience from the concert. I thought that you didn't like pop music and things have to deal with that. Anyway, I've enjoyed it very much! It was the best experience I've ever had in my whole life. I was trying to be with the singers all the time. It was fantastic. I wanted to touch them, as the only way to convince myself that I was with them. I didn't really have to do anything special. I should just take care of them, serving some drinks and food during the rehearshals. That's the advantage of being a volunteer. You get good experiences which you'll never forget! You have to try  once in your life and if you don't like , don't do it again. Regards, ",28.0
1070," Dear Mr Robertson. I am writing to express the deserve of all  students in my class to visit the LONDON FASHION AND LEISURE SHOW at  Central Exhibition Hall, on Tuesday 14 March. All  students have seen an advertisement for that and they would like to go to the show. I think that will be  very good programme. especially the part of the Latest Fashions, because  is something which affect the people of all ages today. But also the rest parts of the show seems to be very interesting. Leisure and Sports Wear is very interesting. I think that young people are affected from that in the way they dressed. Make up and Hairstyles are also very important especially For our class, because the most  students of our class are girls. The girls are interesting more than boys, For make up and hairstyle. and they want to know all the latest news about these . I know that for Tuesday 14 March you have already organise the programme which including for  morning a visit to  Science Museum and For  afternoon shopping but we can change that as Follows: Tuesday morning until 15.00 visit to Science Museum Tuesday afternoon from 1600 to 1900 visit to THE LONDON FASHION AND LEISURE SHOW. Thank you very much. I am apologise For any incovenience. and I am waiting for your reply. Yours sincerelly  [SEP]  Famous people, such as politicians and Film stars, deserve to have a private life without journalists Following them all the time. I think that they have  right because, they are also people like me or like you and they should have  private life. Private life is very important to anyone, because your job create you stress and you should rest, charge your batteries For the next day. If journalists  following you step by step  is difficult to have a private life. On the other hand. I believe that Journalists  doing their work, but sometimes they try to impress their boss and  always. Following the Famous people in order to discover something new of their lifes. Another thing is the pressure. From media owners and the difficulty For someone to Find  job in our days. Media owners want to maximize their profits and always press the journalists to Find something new. To conclude journalists should doing their work but without annoyance to the other people. Private life is right to anyone and all we should respect it. ",27.00

On one hand I would like to travel in July because I'm working in a school and the lessons finish at the end of June so if I could go to this extraordinary opportunity in July it would be better for me because in August I will have to be ready to begin preparing the exams of september. If it is any problem let me know as soon as possible because I'll try to sort it out. On the other hand I think I would rather not sleep in a tent because I had a bad experience once and I would like to try log cabins. although it wouldn't be a problem if I finally have to sleep in a tent. Another point is that I have already chose two activities that you asked me while I am at the camp and  are basketball and golf, they are the best  for me because I think I am good at both and I used to play them before. Finally I want to find out about if  is any supermarket near the camping and if there are any facilities in washing my clotches into the camp. I look forward to reciving a reply from you.  [SEP]  Dear Kim, Last month I had the most exciting experience in my life, as you know I was helping at the pop concert and it was amazing! The concert was in the University in the middle of the field and at the begining when we arrived there weren't many people, only those who had to prepare the stage and the sound  and of course us who had the job of serving drinks during the concert. We arrived quite soon because we had to organise how we went to serve people did with which order, so we started putting all the stuff in  appropiate place. I was very nervous because I'd never been in a concert before and an hour before everything stated the singer and the musicians were there and I couldn't avoid it and I started crying - you can imagine, they were so handsome that I couldn't belive it - I tried to calm down because I had to work, and later I began feeling more comfortable and when the concert started everything was such exciting that the time ran very fast - although I was working - and it was like a dream. Well I think I'm going to remember it all my life and I'm sure that if you had been there you would have enjoyed  very much. See you soon. Best wishes. ",26.0
20," 16 December 2000 Dear Ms Jane Clark, I am writing to express my profound gratitude for an excellent organisation of an annual international arts festival, where I spent two days. The idea of such a festival is really magnificent and I enjoyed various art exhibitions, talks by writers and dance shows. However, the festival could be even better next year. Actually, there were stars and artists from six countries and it would be wonderful if you could invite artists from some others places as well for next year's festival. Besides, I was fascinated by the plays and films and you could probably organize some more. Unfortunately, I am afraid that some concert halls where jazz, rock and classical concerts were held were too small and perhaps you could arrange to use bigger ones. As a matter of fact, I consider one reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events to be brilliant as it offers a unique opportunity to pay for everything all together and be able to attend different events. I believe your festival to be a great event in our cultural life and I am convinced that it is a success. I look forward to coming to the festival again. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Wuthering Heights - Emily Brontë For a start I would like to say that books offer us a wide range of different life stories, both realistic and unusual, they make us thoughtful and form our outlook,  they make us feel and think. As far as I am concerned, I enjoy reading all kinds of fiction literature as each masterpiece is unique in its own way despite the fact what sort of book it is. Stories that are realistic help us to understand better our own life and  people around us. However, reading an unusual, sometimes fantastic story we could dream about fairy lands and observe our world from another point of view. I consider ""Wuthering Heights"" by Emily Brontë to be one of the books that wash away from the soul the dust of  everyday's routine. It is a remarkable piece of literature, which portrays deep feelings of love and hate, depicts strong and unique characters,  reveals eternal concerns with good and bad, life and death. This book is both realistic and unusual and in my opinion this is the core of its originality. It contributes to the world treasurehouse of literature and arouses  irresistable fascination. To draw the conclusion, I'd like to mention that we should value realistic and fantastic stories equally if we are eager to get to understand the world and ourselves. ",38.00

It is famous for its friendly staff and comfortable rooms. The students can get there with the No 35 bus. They must get on the bus from the city centre and get off after five stations at Palace Station. The hotel is opposite the station. At the end-of-conference the college, in which the conference will be held, gives a party for all the students. It will be offered light food, like sandwiches, pommes frites, chips, sweets and different drinks - no alcohol. There will be life music and the students can dance and enjoy themselves. It would be better to wear casual clothes, because they are more comfortable and are liked by students. On the last day, the students can enjoy a sightseeing tour around the city, which can be arranged if the students want to.

383," Dear Sir or madam, I am writing to complain about the musical show called ""Over the Rainbow"" that was advertised in this week's newspaper. According to the advertisement, Danny Brook would be starring  but it was a different actor. It was really disappointing! Furthermore, the show started at the wrong time. It was said that it would start at 19.30 but it was not. It started fourty five minutes later. And if this were not enough, I had no discount in the ticket  as was written. Beside this, we where invited to visit the theatre restaurant after the show, but it was closed because it was being redecorated. So why  you make this invitation? On top of everything, I am on holidays and you can imagine how disappointed I am. It was not a perfect evening out. I suppose that you are understanding my situation, because you did not say the truth. I believe that you will be direct to blame and give me my money back. I look forward to hearing from you.

Sometimes there  advantages but there  some disadvantages too. Firstly, one advantage of it is that you can do things faster. Beside this you can talk with a person in the other side of the world by a computer. It is interesting! Furthermore it helps in house works, at school and you can travel to places very quickly. So the main advantage of the modern technology is that things are becoming easier and easier. On the other hand, there are certain drawbacks. First and foremost is the pollution and big cities are suffering with it. It can cause lots of problems to our health. A further disadvantage is that children are growing up very lazy. They have everything they want very easily and it is not good for their future. To sum up, there are both positives and negatives aspects of the modern technology, because it can makes our lives easy but at the same time it is causing lots of problems for us. ",26.0
606," Dear Mr Helen Ryan, I am writing to you and reply the answers from your letter. I was glad to hearing the news from you and thank you very much! When you mentioned the period of my travelling I'm afraid I  only free in July. Because I go on holiday in July naturally, and I have two terms in June and August. Therefore, I hope that you could make  suitable arguement between you and me. Furthermore, I would like to stay in log cabins which I could feel  more American style of the accommodation. In addition, there should not  too hot inside during July. If I get two choices, I would like to go swimming and take photographs. Because I grew up in my home town that is a seaside city. I was starting trainning since 1996, and I have never give it up. Esepically, it is really good for my healthy during the growth period. Photography is my hobby that is taken in my spare time. I can remember that I used to take photographs on the exhibitions or during the holidays. It must be nice for my memories when I am older. In addition, it could showed people how nice the places  are and the views I have got. Therefore, I would like to do those two activities. Finally, I would like to know  the weather in California. Do I need take too much clothes? Could you tell me that the amount of money I can bring during the holiday? I look forward to hearing from you! Your sincerely SHE DUNES  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable Shopping is concerned that people exchange from money to their demands. There are more and more retailors are opening to customer. Therefore, people used to shopping weekly or monthly. In my opinion, women are really enjoying shopping. It seems a human activity during their spare time. However, we are going to change  traditional system to the ""e-shopping"". It is new for customers by technology they can switch on the computer and click everything they want. Therefore, it looks like a service and  also boring for  customer. I think most of gentlemen dislike shopping. They are always waiting for a long time after women finish their shopping. I believed that most of busy people want go shopping by the easy and quick way. Because they don't like waiting for payment and waste time of life. Therefore, they would like to use ""e-shopping"" which is getting better for their time. The life style has change already from  past. Shopping is  common activity in their life. We must focus on the specific life style, which will make us enjoyable.  In conclusion, I believe that shopping only waste time for human life. And you couldn't get back any more. ",20.0
876," Dear Mr Ryan. Thanks for you letter. I am so exciting that I have won the first prize. I will give you all  information you need and ask some questions. I could only travel on July. As you know, I am a student and the nearest holiday is  summer holiday. But I have booked a flight to home at the beginning of Auguest. And also I would like to go on summer. The accommodation I would like to live in tents. Because I never live in  tents before. I think it is great and I want to try it. I like doing sports. I would like to play basketball and golf when I am at the Camp. I play basketball a lot and I am a member of our college term. But I am not very good at golf. And also I want to ask some questions. What clothes should I taken? How much money should I taken? And how could we meet at the airport? I am looking forward  your reply. Yours sincerely.  [SEP]  As our class is going to mark a short video about daily life at college, I write this report to suggest some lessons and activities which should be filmed. 1. English lesson. Because all students in  English class are from all over the world. We can talk  everybody's feeling  living and study at a foreign country. 2. Computing lesson and computer room. Nowdays  internet makes us closer and closer. We can get all what we want on  internet. It's one of the most important things in our life now. 3. Liabrary. We not only borrow books from  liabrary but also study at  liabrary. Library is very important in our daily life. 4. Canteen. Everyday we go to  canteen have lunch, no matter  you bought food from there or you take your own food. 5. Football. What do you do after class? Joging or doing some sports? You can't forget football. These are what I think should be filmed. If any of you have other suggestion, we can discuss  again. But I think these five lesson or activities are  most common in our daily life at college. ",24.0
984," Dear Helen Ryan I am writing to inform you about your question. At first, I would like to go travel on July, because before them I don't have time to travel. I have to finish my study. Secondly, I want to stay in  log cabin. I think it is more convenient than in tents. And I would like to have a chance about  painting and photography. I am not so fit and well condition, so I don't like to do activitily. However, to draw some beautiful sceanary and to take some picture are  very good experience for me. I hope so  much. Thank you for your invitation. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable. Do you like the shopping? Generally many women would like the shopping include me. Even the young girl wants to go shopping with mum. However, whenever you go shopping, are you usually satisfied with your choice and do you always enjoy the shopping? Perhaps you have an experience unpleased. You could go shopping for some rest to the high street or a department store. Then you could find the cheapest good and in that case, you probably buy it needlessly. Moreover  you bought something then you could find it is a little bit  expensive than the other shop. Both cases are often happened in shopping. If you don't want to regret about shopping, you have to make a shopping list firstly before going shopping. Then you should check the price and the quality of the good. If you remember these two things at least, you could enjoy the shopping. One more thing I recommend you is to leave your credit card at home if you are going only a window shopping. ",20.0
44," International Arts Festival Dear Jane Clark, I am writing to you for your advertisement for the festival. I am  student at London College and studying English. I have always been interesed arts and festivals. It was great that you organised  Art Festival in this City, because people realy needed this kind of sochibal activities here. I have spent two days at the International Arts Festival with some of my friend and I must say we  realy delighted, it was  great idea to do that in London. We all liked  Jazz, rock and classical concerts. However  concert halls were too small and lots of people couldn't get in to  concert halls and there were only six countries stars and artists. I believe  plays and films should be more than it was for next year and  stars and artists should be from round the world. One reasonably priced weeker ticket for all events was excellent because its alway busy for the weekend and people prefer to go any week day. I hope, you will concider about my opinions and  my suggestions would be helpful for the next year. Look forward to hearing from you. Your Sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Freddie I received your letter just this morning. It was very nice to hearing from you. We never like rules, do we? However there are lots of rules in our lives, both at home and at school. In my countries school we are not allowed to have an argument with class-mates and  not allowed to eat at class. We can't listen  music at class as well. We alway have to keep clean every where, but this kind of rules are not very strict I believe. At home  is completely different, my mum is quite organised, so she always puts new rules. Firstly I've to keep clean my room and hoover once a week. I've to cook myself and  worst thing is I'm not allowed to listen  loud music in everywhere at home. I'm not allowed to stay out after midnight. When I groue up I'll change all  rules in my life and I'll make my own rules which are not going to be too strict. Love to hearing from you soon. Love ",25.00
517," Dear Mr I'm writing to complain about what it happened  me two days ago, during you musical show ""OVER THE RAINBOW"". A friend of mine went to see it the last May. He told me to go because the actor's performance was good. So I decided buying a ticket, but no discounts were available. Then with my disappointing I noticed that there was  different actor instead of Danny Brook. Nobody informed me about it. And why did the show start at 20:15 instead of 19:30? After the show, my friends and me decided to go to your restaurant, but we were amazed to find it close. In conclusion, I ask for my money back because it wasn't a perfect evening like your advice showed. I hope that you understand me. Awaiting your reply, Your faithfully  [SEP]  It's true that modern technology has changed our daily life. In the pass, for example, we used to write letters to comunicate, but now we surely send an e-mail, a fax or make a phone . Certainly it will be easier and faster than write, but it was nice when you were waiting for a letter. Nowadays, you have all things immediatly and soon, but will it  be  good ? I think no. Everyone have to use modern technology carefully, because too much technology could be dangerous. It couldn't allow us  to think and to do freely. Today there are children that don't know nothing about nature and its things. Probably, because their parents haven't enough time to go out the city and show them nature. So they prefer leave their sons wecting TV. Modern technology? Yes, but we mustn't loose the values and our free time to stay with our family. ",23.0
835," Dear Helen Ryan, I have received your letter: I was very glad to know that I have won two weeks at Camp California. I have to take part in basketball competitions all year long, except during July, so it is the only month in which I can travel. I would be grateful if I could have the accomodation in a log cabin: I would prefer not to stay in a tent because of my height, I am so tall that I could never stand up. I would like to play basketball because my trainer said that it would be suitable not to stop practising it during July. I can play basketball very well I would be grateful if you could teach me to play golf. I have never practised this sport, so I can't play golf at all. Would you mind sending me some information about the kind of clothes I will need? I would like to know how much money you suggest to bring. I would be grateful to receive some information about the meals at the camp and I hope that it will not be a problem for you if I am a vegan. I am looking forward to hearing from you, Yours sincerely, Elena Pabori  [SEP]  I think that if we want to show the good points of our typical school-day, we should film the large number of sport activities that this school organises because students are compelled by them to come to school with enthusiasm. Only  who gets good marks can take part in theese activities, so sport activities are seen as a prize, so while the students are playing basket ball, tennis, volleyball... or they are swimming you can see satisfaction on their faces, and our volleyball team is excellent. It would be nice to film an Ancient Greek Poetry lesson because  Ancient Greek teacher is very good at explaining; she is excellent at catching our attention and she wants everyone to tell the class the impressions and emotion they have reading Saffo, Alceo, Alcmone.... In my opinion we should film  science lesson, so that our teacher, listening to her own statements could realise that they make no sense! ",36.0
253," Monday, the 5th of June 2000 To the Circle Theatre's manager Dear Mister, I recently had the opportunity to see ""over the rainbow"" which was played last week in the Circle theatre. I'm writing to you because I'm very disappointed by the bad evening I spent there. Actually, I read the advertisment for the show and there were a few mistakes on it. In fact, Danny Brook didn't play or appear on stage last Tuesday, the role was played by another - a quite bad - actor, less famous than Danny Brook. I'm also sorry because I had to wait 45 mn before the pieces started. I can't accept waiting so long for the result I had. I was in London with some friends (we were students) and no discount was proposed or made for us. We had to pay £15 each for seeing a miserable pieces. After the piece, we waned to eat at the theater restaurant but we couldn't. It was apparently closed and I'm asking you why. As you can see, there are some (volontary?) mistakes on the advertisment you made. We didn't have a ""perfect evening out"" at all. That's why I'm asking you for giving us  money back. I'm sure we'll find a compromise and I'm really looking forward to hearing from you soon. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  An unusual part of life. Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, and half a week later, all the school knew about me. I had a strange feeling then because it was just amazing to notice how money can attract so much people. I started to have a lot of new friends, they all wanted to be my best friend. Actually, my best friend would still remain Pat, even if he failed me. It's not easy to keep such an enormous secret and I couldn't keep it inside of me. I became quickly bored by this hypocrital attention they had for me. They didn't stop giving me advice or telling me what to do with my money. I always has been involved in many differents associations, which are fighting against AIDS or cancer. I knew at this moment what to do exactly and finally, I could refind my ordinary life as an unpopular student. ",35.0
96," Dear Manager of the Circle Theatre. I am writing regarding to our visit to the Circle Theatre  the 17th June. When we saw your advertisment for the musical show, over the rainbow, we immediatly decided that this must be a perfect evening out. There was in our opinion two reasons for that, our favourite actor Danny Brook and the opportunity to visit your theatre restaurant afterwords. However the evening become very disappointing. Firstly, Danny Brook was not acting, there was another unknown actor and he was not good. Secondly, the show was supposed to start  19.30, but did not start until 20.15. Thirdly, in your advertisment it says that discounts should be available, but it was not. Above these the restaurant was closed because of  water leakage. I am therefore asking for a compensation for our disappointing evening and hope we can reach a sollution as soon as possible. Yours sincerelly Adra Johansson  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. It didn't take more than one day before everyone knew about my decision. I had thought about it for many years but never been able to fulfill my dreams. This year I had the opportunity to make my dreams come through. However I wasn't sure if my decision was right and therefore I decided to discuss it with Pat. Pat is my best friend, since we first met in primary school. It is now twenty years ago. I really like Pat, she's funny, has a good sence of humor and like me she loves to discuss everything. So therefore, my choise to ask her about my decision was the best  I could do. She really listen to me and told me that I did the right thing and persuaded me to send in my application for an language course in England. I wanted to keep this as a secret until I received the answer from the School. But it is ok, I still like Pat, even though she can't keep a secret. ",27.0

I have been informed that all accommodation and travel cost are paid for  the company. I can only travel in July because I am working as a receptionist in a hotel and they would only let me have two weeks off in that month. I would prefer to stay in a log cabin rather than in  tents, because I find it more confortable to sleep in  beds, but it wouldn't be a problem if I have to sleep in  tents. I would love to do climbing and surfing just because those are sports I have never praticed before, that means I do not have any experience on the subject. Please let me know the kind of clothes we will be wearing, would I need to take a suit? Are there going to be any formal parties? It is important for me to know if we need  money and in that case, how much money would you recommend me to take? I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely, Manuel P. Martinez  [SEP]  June 13th, 2000 Dear Kim, As you already know, I was at a pop concert last month. It was great! The concert was organized by the community so everyone who wanted to help was welcomed. The concert lasted for four hours as a lot of small local bands played. My job was to set  the stage where the bands played. It was hard and it took me the whole day. I was there at seven a.m and didn't go home until seven a.m the following day. Of course I didn't do it alone, we were a group of about ten guys. After the show we had to stay and clean the park, which was full of empty cans. The part that I enjoyed the most was that I felt I was doing something worthly for the community and also that I got to meet a lot of people. I made great friends with the group I worked with. I think it was a great experience, and I hope we will organize another concert soon. I am looking forward to seeing you. Best wishes ",37.0
511," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to express my great disappointment about the musical show I attended in your theatre last weekend. According to your advertisement, it stars DANNY BROOK AND TINA TRUELOVE, but surprisinggly, it  was proformed by a different actor  who I even didn't know the name. In addition, the show was supposed to be started at 19:30 but it was half  hour later, until 20:15. To make the matter worse, I had expected the ticket with some discount, but when I went to the ticket box, there was no any discount available. The last thing is the theatre restaurant was closed after the show, because it only opened until 9 o'clock at night. You can imagine how disappointed I am when spending money on such a terrible evening. I would like you to look into the matter immediately and I insisted on  some money back. I look forward to receiving a satisfactory reply as soon as possible. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Nowadays, we use a lot of modern technology both at home and   office but it has its aventage and disaventage. The first and most important thing is that modern technology have made our life easier, for instance  ricer cooker is a great invention, all you have to do is putting rice on it and switch  on, it makes cooking more effeciently. Furthmore, we can use  computer and telephone a lot. Wherever you are, you can get in touch with people whenever you want. It is often suggested that, modern technology makes the gap bigger between peoples, they get used to communicating with the machine then forget how to deal with human beings. To sum up, I believe that modern technology could help our daily life but we should not alway rely on it. ",24.0
762," Dear Helen Ryan Thank you very much for the prize  two weeks at Camp California in the USA. On the following there is some further information from me. I would like to travel only in July, because I have so many assignments to finish before the end of June. I do not think I have enough time to prepare somethings to travel before of July. In fact, I really do not mind to stay in log cabins, but I have never stayed in a tent before. I think its might be fun to try to stay in the tent this time. I would prefer to choose tennis and swimming. I used to be a tennis player when I was fifteen. I won first prize two years ago. The other activity is swimming. I started to learnt when I was five years old. I was a swimming teacher for a year in a sports club. Now I own a swimming school and have trained the staffs every week. I think both activities I have chosen are suitable for me and I am sure I can do well. What type of clothes I should bring with me? and is there any equipment I need to bring with me. I would like to know how much money I need to spend during a camping. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely (Mali Ratana)  [SEP]  13th July 2000 Dear Kim Thank you very much for your letter that I just got last week. How are you? I hope you have a nice summer time now. I wondered who had told you about I had helped  a pop concert last month. Anyway, it is doesn't matter now who had told you, but I was very happy and enjoyed it. Well, I am going to tell you about it. First of all, I had to been train by the concert's staff for a day. Before the concert started I had to help the staff prepared a stage,  like put the instruments where they should be on the stage,. And then, I had to help the singer to do some make up. I was very frightening I might put too much make up on their faces, but everything was allright. After that, I had to help them to prepare some lunch when the concert had started. I was running around to find something I could do, like serving some drinks for  staffs or the singers. After the concert finished I had to help them cleaned up everything. I was so tired, but enjoyed. I really like to help people without  something back. This experience I was so prond  and very enjoyed. I think I didn't waste my time at all. I spent my free time to helping them  its made my life a little bit busy. I think I have learnt a lot from this experience. To helping people you should not expect anything back to you, except happiness and enjoyable. Well, I think I must stop writing now. I hope you are enjoying with my experience. I hope to see you sometime next month. Love ",26.0
1049,"  Mr. Robertson: First of all our class would like to give you our special thanks about the programme you gave us yesterday afternoon. After reading the hole organized programme, we all agreed about the sightseeing  by bus around London wich will give us the knowledge about this fantastic city we all want to meet since  time ago. The main purpose of our letter it's to explain about the London Fashion and Leisure Show. We found the advertisment in a local newspaper article and have been thinking it could be such a good opportunity, because the show consists on these topics: . Latest Fashions . Leisure and sports wear . Make up . Hairstyles. On the other hand, and the most important, it is free for students. After being discussing , we want to suggest how we think the programme should be re-arranged. Instead of going to the science museum, we could go to the London Fashion and Leisure Show wich is opened on Tuesday, march 14 from 10 am to 19 pm. After that we could continue our trip as it had been arranged previously. Yours sincirely  [SEP]   Best Detective Stories of Agatha Christie - Agatha Christie. A good book should interest, amuse or teach the reader something. Agatha Christie always was my favourite writer. Not only because she's famous or wrote lots of books, but she knows how to introduce caracthers or how to tell a good story us though decieving the readers. One of her most interesting and famous work is a novel called ""The Orient Express"". It's a detective story, like all the stories written by her. In our words the story is settled on a train wich tooks a trip along the orient. On the train, all the passangers seem to be involved in a crime. This is such a fasinating story or it's the way Agatha Christie tells it. The mistery is kept until the last page of the book. I read it and I have really enjoyed it. It has been  fabulous experience so if anybody would like to read a good detective story, try to read Agatha Christie's detective story and you wouldn't regret it at all. ",11.00
413," Dear Sir, I am writing to you to complain about the musical show ""Over the Rainbow"" which I went to see last week. First of all, the actors that played  the show were differents to Danny Brook and Tina Truelove. Besides of this they were not good as actors, so I am quite disappointed. Then, the show had to start at half past seven and I had to wait fourty-five minutes because it started later. But it is not all because in the advertisement  appeared the possibility of discounts  available and it is false, I had to pay £20 for each ticket. Finally, I wanted to visit your theatre restaurant and have a good dinner after the show but it was impossible. The restaurant was closed because most of the employees was on holidays and there were not enough people to attend the demand. In conclusion, it was not the perfect evening that I expected, so I am therefore writing to ask for a full refund of the tickets. I will be looking forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, and now my best friend knows that I will go to visit her next week. Alice is my best friend and we met twenty years ago. We went to the same school and we had the same hobbies. It was perfect because we always were together and doing interesting activities like snow board. One day her mother died and she had to move to Germany where her sister was living. But she was very sad because she knew that it will be very difficult  to see eachother in the future. After that, we wrote letters and she phoned me once time a week but it wasn't the same. I couldn't explain all my problems to her and her voice had changed. Finally, I decided to visit her but I wanted that it was a surprise. I worked hard during one month and I could save  money to buy a ticket for the plane. I decided to explain all my plans to Pat and she promised me that she didn't say anything but it wasn't true. Yesterday she phoned to Alice and explained all. In spite of this I am very happy because I know that Alice is preparing many activities  to do together and  to spend the best week in our lifes.

543," Dear Helen, I would like to thank you for the letter I have just received. First of all I would like to point out that it is a great pleasure for me to take part in your competition. I would like to assure you that I would do my best to be the one of the winners in your competition. Now, If I would like to state some of the information that you may need. Firstly, I have to say that I can travel only in July this year. This is mostly because I have a job and I have made further arrangements for the other summer months. Secoundly, I would be very grateful if you can accommodate me in tents rather than long cabins. It is mostly because I like fresh air at night. From the list of activities in which I will have a chance to compete I have choosen: basketball and swimming. I am very good at those kinds of sports and think that I could be the winner. Finally, I would like to ask you how many clothes and how much money should I take with me. I will wait to hearing from you, soon. Yours sincerely, Piotr Kaczmarski  [SEP]  I do agree with the opinion that shopping is not always enjoyable. Nowadays many young people like to do their shopping. But, isn't it a kind of entertaintment? In the first place, I would like to point out that to go shopping does not always mean to buy something. A lot of people, especially women, go to do their shopping only for fan. In such a situation they are looking for something that they might buy. But, what about real shopping. I mean shopping with a real purpose. For example, emagine that you are a bride and you have to buy an appropriate suit. It's a real nightmare when you try to match everything: from the size, the colour to the sawings of the suit that is acceptable for everyone. On the other hand it is a great achievement for you when you buy the suit that is perfect for everyone. To sum up, I would like to say that shopping is enjoyable when you are going only for fan. But, when you want to buy something special it's a real nightmare. ",23.0

It will be a great opportunity for me to see the United States and I am so happy about that, I can not explain it. You want to know some further information from me. About the date, when I want to travel can I say that it is only possible for me on July because I have to do some exams at the school. I would prefer to the accommodation at the camp a tent, the reason is that I like to live realy natural and it is more enjoyable to live in a tent then in  cabins. As activities I can say that I like every sport, but basketball and tennis would be perfect for me. In basketball I have  more practise then in tennis. I play every weekend on competitions with my local team and about tennis it is that I tried but it is not like my basketball experience. Also I want to know how much clothes and  money I would need for these two weeks. Please write  me  your answer as quick as possible. I hope I can hear from you soon. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Kim, How are you my lovely penfriend? I hope good. You want to know how was it to work and help at a pop concert? It is marvelous. You see the stars so near and also you can chat with them. On my first day I should help to bring the staff for the band, things like guitars, drums and others. It was maybe hard work for a while but I was so happy about that to help on a real big pop concert I can't decribe it. On the other two days I helped to prepare the breakfast, lunch and diner for the band. You are always so near to these people and after a while it is normal to stay and chat with Brian Adams, for example. I realy enjoyed that and it was one of the greatest, when not the greatest experience in my life. On the other hand it was a good paid job with 15 pounds per hour, what do you can say. The organizer of the tournement have spoken with me and asked me if I want I could do the same work in two months at the concert by the Rolling Stones is that not fantastic. I couldn't believe it but he gave me the contract to fill it out. I hope Kim you was not too jealous about that, sorry. Please write  me soon, I'm waiting. Loves ",28.0
186," Dear Sir/Madam, I went to the Circle Theatre to see the musical show ""Over The Rainbow."" Unfortunately, I had a very disappointing evening, because very little of what was offered in the advertisements was provided. Firstly, we were informed that Danny Brook was starring but a different actor was starring in the show and he was really disappointing. Secondly, in the advertisement it was written that the show was to start at 19:30. However, it started at 20:15, almost an hour late. Thirdly, it was written that discounts were available but we were again frustrated, seing they were not available. Finally, although we were informed that the theatre restaurant would be open after the show, it was closed because the show had started late. As you can see, most of the offered activities in the advertisements were not provided. We did not have ""a perfect evening"" as it was written, actually we had an evening full of the theatre's mistakes and were extremely disappointed. I suppose it will be better for your theatre's reputation to give at least some of my money back. Yours Sincerely,  [SEP]  MY LIFE AND MODERN TECHNOLOGY Here we are, in the 21st century...

First, I am able to come only in July, because my examination session is due from the 24 June till 26 June. I would prefer to be accomodated in a log cabin as  do not like sleeping on the mattres and I get  allergy to rubber. From the listed activities I would like to choose singing, because it is my hobby and I also sing in  local chorus. Photography is my second favourite subject. I won third prize in  competition organized by our college. Could you, pleas send me some extra information regarding the ammount of money I should take to cover any other expenses, and also, what kind of clothes I should take. I am looking forward to hearing from you Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Is shopping not always enjoyable? There are different opinions and points of view. I like shopping very much. Firstly, you have a wide variety of shops you can buy food . For example, large supermarkets with dishes ready to eat. Even if you do not have any cooking skills you can enjoy exotic meals. On the other hand, some people complain that there are a lot of artificial products, which are quite unhealthy, but very expensive. The second thing I like about shopping is the possibility to find your own style  buying clothes in the small boutiques. You can always ask for good advice from the experienced shop attendants, which does not necessarily cost you extra money. However, someone else may say, it takes too much time. The third reason I enjoy shopping is that I never go alone just to buy a thing I need. I always take my friend with me so we can chat or have coffee in the shop's cafe. Although my brother thinks the better way to have fun is to watch TV than to be pushed in crowded shops, I do not agree. To sum up I agree that shopping is not always enjoyable, but for me it is and I like it. ",33.0
66," Dear Miss Clark, I went to your annual international arts festival. I really enjoyed it, although I feel it could have been better. But firstly I want to congratulate you for organizing such a huge festival, people need this kind of events. Secondly I would like to make some remarks about your festival so that you can improve it. As it was written  in your advertisement, artists should have come from around the world but only six countries were represented, I was quite disappointed. However the concerts were great, but unfortunately, some concert halls were too small and it was as hot as a micro-wave inside. Plays and Films were good and I liked them, but there were only a few, I hope there will be many more next year. One of the most positive aspect of your festival is the price of your weekend ticket. As a student, the low priced ticket certainly athacted me a lot and gave me the opportunity to see and hear wonderful artists. Finally, I would like to make one big suggestion: you should find a place for a camping so that people who come from a long way don't have to spend money on accomodation. Anyway, I'm looking forward to coming to your festival next year. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Money, Money, Money Young people always need money, specially students who don't earn their life. They need money to pay  their studies or for going out, but how to find a job which is good and not under-paid? One of the best is working in a big supermarket. Some can find it boring but it is well-paid and not too tiring. Furthermore departement stores are always looking for students who would like to work. Another solution could be working as a barman, the problem is that you go to bed very late, but it's very exciting because you meet a lot of people and enjoy your night. Unfortunately it's not possible unless you can rest in the morning. If you are a really good student in one subject, you can provide private lessons which is one of the most prolific job but do it only if you like teaching. Otherwise you should try to find another job. The main thing to remember is that there  many possibilities but you have to try to find them and not just say: ""I want to work and earn money"".

1086," To Mr Robertson, Firstly, I would like to thank you for the programme that you provided. It was  very good programme, especially the river trip to Greenwich, which I am sure the whole class would enjoy. However, our class has spotted an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and would all wish to attend. It will be held at the Central Exhibition Hall in London on the 14th March. It will be from 10.00 till 7.00pm. The show will be about all the latest fashion, leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles. We would also not have to worry financially as it is free for students. This will be a great opportunity for us because we will be able to find out more about the people of London and their fashions and style we might also get a change to meet new people and interest with them. The whole class is also very excited about this fashion show and would really appreciate your giving them a change to go. I have a few suggestion on how the programme could be changed to fit the London Fashion and Leisure Show in . We could do as planned for Monday and move going to the Science Museum from Tuesday to Wednesday afternoon. We would have to forgo the shopping as we might not have enough time and the exchange rate might be too high for us to do much shopping. We can however go and look around the shopping mall if we have time after the show. Lastly, I would be very grateful if you could give us your permission to go to the show. I hope you would consider this matter. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Everyday, something changes and we become more modern companies use computers instead of books, dentist use modernized electrical item instead of just a  plier, even homes are effected. From letters to emails, from gas stoves to electric stoves and microwaves, but we aren't just going to stop here are we? No, in the future, the present will be the past and these things now new to use will be old, outdated and changed. I see a very different home for us in the future. Most things will be computerised. We might even be using voice identification and fingerprints instead of keys. We an on and off lights with touch pads and remote controllers. We might even be able to open the door without getting out from the living room. Cameras will be something usual in every house instead of that little peephole in your door. Although all that may change our houses may be still the same. The rooms and size should remain as it was and the living rooms and all may still be decorated in the same style. We might still favour that old carpet and couch. The furniture should not change that much on the outside and the amount of rooms should not change too. In the future, every child might have a laptop. And instead of going to school, why not let school come to you? We will be learning at home using computers and disc. Never have to leave the house or wake up so early. Another way our home could be different in the future is probably the utilitles we are using. We might not need maids to do housework anymore as they can easily be replaced with a robot, a machine, or something other with the same purpose. Our homes will still be the same in terms of the kitchen, it will still be filled with vegetables and meat. This is because people won't miss the great taste of food although it could be subsituted to a vitamin pill or two. Lastly, I think that all this changes won't really be noticed as we change it daily and slowly instead  abruptedly. People will be able to adjust and change with the times. ",37.00
85," Dear Jane Clark, I'm writting to you because I've been in the International Arts Festival and it was a pleasure. Let me introduce myself: I'm Mary, I'm nineteen and I'm studying arts. As well, I want you to know my opinion and I'd like to give you my suggestions, because it would be useful to you for the next festival. Firstly, I want to congratulate you for the idea, I think that it's very important the development of the arts and that everybody could assist without paying too much. Having a ticket for all the events is a great method because it's an organised way of paying and you win time. On the other hand, I must tell you that some concert halls are too small, so you can't be enough confortable to apreciate the event. Other thing, is that the artists come only from six countries, so don't cheat the people by saying that they are from all  the world. In my opinion, you should call more artist from other countries and have some concert halls bigger or may be change the distribution. Well, I think that everything is told but could you tell me, if it's possible, if there will be more plays and films next year? I'm waiting for your answer.  Faithfully,  [SEP]  Dear Jane, Thanks for your letter, it was nice to hear from you again. I've recently started the classes so all the rules were given to us, like you know,  the first day. As you want me to tell you how about the rules are here, I'll start. Firstly, in our classroom you can't shout, you must be quite and sat . You must pay attention always because you don't know if the teacher will ask you some question. In exams, you can't talk to the teacher, either you mustn't eat chuingham or take a walkman with you. In my home I can avoid that rules. My mum only doesn't want me to arrive late. However, I can go dancing whenever I want but  telling her previously. My mum is a lovely woman and she doesn't know how much I love her because most of the day I'm outside, but that's the true. My father is a bit jealous but agrees with what my mum says. So, I'm free when I'm out of the school. I'd like it would be nicer going there. Lots of love, ",26.00
643," Dear Ryan, I'm just finish reading the letter from you about won first prize in your competition  two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. You had ask me  some further information. I would like to travel on the July only Because I'll be free for the whole month. So any date on the July. I'd like to accommodation at Camp California in tents. Because i like to sleep in  tent when i go camping. Also I would like to choose the two activities that you had gave me on the list. I would like to choose Swimming and Photography. I'm good in swimming. I used to swim for the school team. But I never do photography before. I love to take a photo but never have  chance to do so. But I have  chance to choose. Also I would like to ask you some questions. Do I have to bring a lots of money? I mean do I have to pay for the tent? What about the clothes do I have to bring a lot? That is all i want to know. Thank you Your sincerely LINDSAY WATTANA  [SEP]  10/05/2000 Dear Kim, Hi, how are you? I'm fine. I just got your letter yesterday. You had ask me a question about my experience  helping at a pop concert. You wanted me to tell you about it right? Well, it  quite fun while i  helping them to do the stuff before the concert  gonna start. I have to get everythings that they need up to the stair. It's so tried. Then after that I have to help them carry all the clothes for the singer to wear from the bus down in to the stuff room. I saw Westlife too you know they are so cute. Then I can take  rest  about 30 mins. After that i have to go in to the stuff room again because they wanted me to go and buy some drink for the singer. After i came back i have to help them clean all the make up stuff. The concert begin... that mean i can take  rest until the concert finish. After the concert had finish i have to help them again to clean all the stuff. the carry everythings that I can carry back to the bus. We were so tried but it's good fun. I think this experience was quite interesting. If somebody ask me to go and help again I would like to go for sure. That's all i did in the pop concert for my experience. What about your experience? Don't forget to tell me about yours okay... Better go to sleep now. Bye Antonia. ",21.0
132," June 17 2000 Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to you about my complaints of mine about the musical show of your theater, that I have watched a week ago, during my stay in London. That evening, the problems started with the tickets... On the contrary with  the advertisement, that was published on the Guardian, there were no discounts available, although I had an International Student Identity card. Secondly, the show has started with a delay of 45 minutes, and because of this all my arrangements for that night were delayed. Another problem was the starring male actor: the well known and talented actor, mentioned in the advertisement was replaced with another one, who was really very disappointing and after the performance, I visited the theater restaurant, which was said to be open and available for meals after the show; but it was closed. So, I did not have the ""perfect evening out"" as stated in your advertisement. I think you owe me an excuse and a full refund. I'm looking forward to hear from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Clothes of the Future Have we ever seen a naked person in the streets? Except  some very extraordinary cases, no. Tell me, why  people care so much about what they wear and what others wear? Because, the clothes have a crucial part in our everyday lives. Maybe because of this, just like living things, the clothes have evolution. This evolution has never stopped and it will continue. How about the clothes of people, a hundred years later? In my opinion the clothes of the world, after a century , will be styled in the Japanese way: minimalist and naturalist. Throughout the history, we have observed that people get rid of everything that is not natural, such as corsets and in the future belts and ties might be ""out"". Of course, the technology will change too. Maybe, new kinds of fabrics, that are capable of insulating light, or heat will be used. Actually, some clothes like that are being developed today; but only as prototypes and it is possible to see that they will be widely used in the future. Finally, it seems to me that, the clothes of tomorrow will be quite naturalist and minimalist and also, the fabrics that are used will change too. In fact, we can not know, what will the time give and take away, so let's wait and see: the clothes of the future. ",34.0
171," London, June 17th, 2000 Dear Sir, Last week I bought some tickets to the musical show ""Over the Rainbow"", thinking that I would have a perfect evening, like its advertisement tell us. Unfortunately, I had a terrible evening. At first I became worried because there wasn't any discounts available, like your advertisement say . And I became even more angry  to have to wait 45 minutes for the show to begin. It's necessary to start on time, and your paper was informing  that it would begin at 19:30. It didn't happen. To complete my sadness, the main actor was replaced by another one who I've never heard anything from, and did not have the same talent that the one shown on the advertisement do. I'm writing to you to complain about this show, and to ask for my money back. It isn't fair not returning the money for a person who bought tickets to watch a show that was supposed to be great, but actually was a shame. I'm looking forward to your answer. Cordially,  [SEP]  Secrets between friends Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. And because of that, everyone at school happened to know that Ali was dating Nick, that used to be Caroline's boyfriend at the time. Pat was Ali's best friend, and because of that, Ali told her that she was going out with Caroline's boyfriend, but asked her to keep the secret. One week later, everyone at school started to laugh at Caroline and look down on Ali and Nick. Caroline discovered everything, and argued with the infidel couple. It was a big quarrel, people that were many meters distant could hear it. Pat entered the fight, and it became more loud and agressive. One more week has passed, and things became calm: Ali decided to never look Pat on the fact anymore. They have turned themselves into big enemies. And Nick told her that his real love was his girlfriend Caroline, and that they weren't going to break up. Poor Ali.. So, it's very important to be a person than can keep secrets, even your own secrets, or a friend's one. One of the most beautiful things on the world is the true and loyal friendship. Then, we have to be as best secret keepers as possible, or we will end  like Ali and Pat. ",25.0
426," Dear Sirs, The Circle Theatre was so far the best theatre in my opinion, but now, I must change my opinion. I visited your Theatre yesterday. I would like to see the best musical show with the best artists. Unfortunately instead of Danny Brook we have seen  unknown actor. We have disappointed. Moreover this show did not start at 19.30, but 45 minutes later. Another problem - the tickets for students according to your advertisement should be available with discounts - unfortunately I could not buy such  ticket. During the interval I would  drink coffee in  theatre restaurant - it was closed. I don't know, why? I no thought, that so serious  theatre makes such mistakes. In accordance with, I would like to ask you to return me my money. I hope that your answer will be positive, and in the future in your theatre all will be O.K. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  What will clothes be like 100 years from now? ""Fashion of the Future"" - it is  good question. Fashion are changing every year. During the next fashion shows we observe new clothes. In my opinion in the future people will wear clothes made of a natural fabrics; silk, cotton, leather, wool. All syntetic material will be uncomfortable for these people. Women will prefere the long skirts and short blouses and jackets. Of course, it will be smart clothes. Young people will wear jeans and T-shirt. Such clothes is comfortable and easy in using. Teenagers have not free time to go to a washing-cleaner. Men will wear as usualy - a suit. Fashion colours - it will be earth colours: grey, blue, yellow, brown. For special ocassions, for example - the party, the concert, people will wear very smart. I think that it will be: dresses,  suits swewed by the well-known tailors.  All materials should be thin, delicate and soft, because of the warmly climate. I think that, we will observe a little and slow changes in fashion, but I hope that new clothes will be always pleasent for people. ",23.0
1123," Dear Mr Robertson, Firstly, I am being the representative of my class to thanks  for organising a good programme in London, especially the visiting of  Science Museum and National Art Gallery. We know that it is a good chance for us to learn more different things and  can widen our knowledge in the Science Museum. In addition, we can appreciate and enjoy the art in  National Art Gallery. Unfortunately, I know that most of the students have already visited this two places before. So we decide to choose the other programme which have seen as an entertainment. It is the LONDON FASHION AND LEISURE SHOW. The show is hold at  Central Exhibition Hall, London. The date is on Tuesday March 14, from 10.00-19.00. It shows the latest fashions including leisure and sports wear. In spite of these, there is also make up and hairstyles which attract girls most. Secondly, the show is a great opportunity because it holds  only 1 day which is Tuesday March 14. And, it is free for students. So I think it is worth visiting. Personally, here is my some suggestions about how the programme could be changed. We can join the programme that you planned as usual and  we go to that fashion show on Tuesday. Finally, the above information is my opinion and I hope you can accept it. Thanks for your kind attention. Your sincerely,  [SEP]  How is the home of the future will be? Remain the same, as usual or have a great difference? For me, I think people's home may not be built on the ground. The home will be built on the sky - so as to save more land to build the other buildings. As the home is built on the sky. It will save a lot of electricity as solar energy is used. And, there should be a electrical servant in everyone's home. So there's no need for people to do the household work. There should be no beds at home because some pills are invented to make people not sleepy. If you're tire, the pill can give you vitamin, protein and make you refresh For electrical goods, there will be no any kind of electrical products except computer. People will do anything on the computer, including watching TV, listen to music,  chat with people. As the computer is being as a multi-functional products. on the other hand, there're some ways that remain the same. The toilet should remain the same as people need to use  daily and nothing can replace it. Second, there should be friends and family members in the home to provide joyful and fun. Since friends and family members won't change and replace, by anything. These are my imagination. I really wonder how the home of the future will be. ",25.00
806," Thank you very much for this occasion I'd like to travel only in July, because, in the rest of the year, I'm working in a bank. The second reason is the weather. I love travelling when the weather is warm. About the accommodation, I'd prefer to stay in  log cabins, because for me and my family's more comfortable. I have a baby and three dogs, so it should be better in  log cabins. I'd like spend all of  time in a swimming-pool because I love swimming. I like also surfing, because I love the wind in the hair and the fresh on my body. Only one question about a baby's accomodation. May I have a babysitter? I'd like to have more free time for myself and my health. I've never been there, so it will be a pleasure for me. Let me say still thank you. I'm looking forward to meting you Best regards Irene Venerio  [SEP]  Dear Kim, How are you? I'm fine. I'm sorry I didn't write  you before, but I was so busy with my exams. First of all, I want to tell you what happened last month. Do you remember which is my favourite group? So, You don't believe me, but I enjoed helping at a Oasis's pop concert. I was a great and wonderful experience. The group needs to found a good microphone for the concert, because the singer lost his microphone last concert. Me and my friend were there to hear the sound-check, and when I understood  was happing on the stage, I decided to help them. Of course you know, I'm a singer, so I came back quigky to my home, I picked  my microphone, and I handed it to the singer. The concert was absolutely fantastic. I was so glad, because in the ending of  show the singer kissed me and dedicated to me a lovely song. Can you immagine? Ok, write  me soon, huge hug and kisses Yours Irene ",29.0
197," Dear Sir: I am writing to you this letter because I would like you to know about a musical show which I went to see to the Circle Theatre. First of all, I wanted to see this musical 'Over the Rainbow' because the actor Danny Brook was acting in it. But when the musical started I got very disappointed because Harry Smythe, a not very famous actor, was acting instead of Danny Brook. Then, the musical didn't start on time. It supposed to start at 19.30 pm in the evening but we had to wait for more than half an hour. All the people got very angry. Also I bought a £20 ticket because in the advertisement for the show was put that discounts were available for £10 £15, £20 tickets. I couldn't have my ticket discounted because when I went to buy it they told me that was untrue. Furthermore, in the advertisement was put that the theatre restaurant was opened but when we went there after the show, it was closed because the chief of the restaurant was ill. It was ridiculous! In conclusion, I didn't have my perfect evening out, in other words, I had a very disappointing evening so I am asking you for my money back. I would like to have my money back in ten days, in the other case, I would have to sue you. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. I'm telling you this because I had a big trouble a few days ago because of her. Pat used to be my best friend but a few days ago I knew all the truth. I used to tell Pat everything about myself - my problems with my parents, my problems with the school, friends and more. I was always talking to her and she was always listening to me but she didn't talk to me very much about herself. At first, I thought it was a bit strange but I didn't care too much about that and I easily forgot it. In other words, Pat knew all my secrets. I started to get along with other people and had new friends but I continued telling Pat my secrets. My new friends sometimes talked to me about Pat and they asked me once if we were close friends. I asked them why they had asked me that. Their answer surprised me too much. They told me Pat used to be a close friend of them and she used to talk about me and my problems. So, they had already knew all my secrets for a long time!  I got very angry and immediately I went to talk to Pat. At first, Pat denied all the things my friends told me about herself but she finally agreed with that. I asked her why she couldn't keep my secrets and she told me that it was impossible for her keeping secrets. She was very sorry about that and  few days after she moved in to another city and actually I don't know anything about her. I thanked my new friends for not to tell anybody my secrets  though before the trouble they and me weren't very  friends. Now I'm very happy with my new friends and I have learnt that I can't trust anybody too much because you don't really know how the person is like. ",33.0
474," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to you because I am really dissapointed bout ""Over the Rainbow"" which I saw the other day in my stay in London which your company organized. I put off everything to watch this performance but everything that was written in your advertisement wasn't true at all. In your advertisement  said the show will start at 19:30 however it began at 20:15. I can understand that a musical show has to be prepared and it takes time. Even though, I can't understand  the actor of this play Danny Brook and Tina Truelove doesn't appeared in the play and there was another actor instead of Danny Brook. After all this I wanted to make my evening pleasant however for my surprise the theatre restaurant was closed because  some problems of sanitary. I explained to you every detail about what happened in the musical show and I want you refund my money and send to me an apology for what happenned there. I hope hear from you  sooner as possible and thanks for understand my situation. Yours fainthfully Phat Cheung  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed your daily life? Many years ago human beings or whatever we  called was another animal species but when they tried to use rocks to make a fire we changed everything. Modern technology changed our lifes in many ways, when I have to wake up earlier I use my alarm clock, if I have to wash my teeth I use my toothbrush with a little of toothpaste. I use my desk to study which was made with trees cut down and emsamblish by machines more powerful than handwork. Even though, this is not enough  the technology created a better way of communication, first there were letters, after telephones and now we can write letters and receive them through  internet. It is not necessary to imagine things, you can travel all around  just making a click with your mouse and you are there. If I am hungry I open the refrigerator and take foods and cook it with a microwave. When I have a headache I ate pills, made by technology. I think everything round us is thanks for technology but we can't forget that this things was made by us. The human being. Everything has advantages and disadvantages but the most important thing is how we use it. If we creates guns to protect our homes, others will use it to steal our homes,  take advantage from the indefense people. However, the technology never stops, we always search  new things because we are made to compete, discover, think  things which we don't know. ",22.0
196," Dear Manager, Last week, during my holiday in London, I had the opportunity to see the show ""Over the Rainbow"" at the Circle Theathre. That is why I am writing this letter; to inform you about the problems I had. First of all, the tickets were too expensive. I was told that there were some discounts to students, but at the moment I bought the ticket, they charged me a full price. The day of the show, we got to the theather at 19:30. Instead, due to some technical problems, it began at 20:15. Second, I was really disappointed when I found out that Danny Brook, the best actor I have never known and the reason for which I decided to see the show, was not going to be performing. Third, the theatre restaurant was closed because the cheff did not show up. I was really looking forward to eating at that place. In conclusion, I would appreciate  if you could, please, send me my money back because I did not have the perfect evening that I expected. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat was not very good at keeping secrets. Sally, her best friend, had told her what had been happening at her house for the last two months. Pat knew something was wrong because she had known Sally since they were five years old, but she did not  why she was acting so strange. Sally did not want to tell anybody about her problem, but she knew she could trust Pat. So Sally started to talk. She had seen her stepfather hitting her mother everytime he was drunk. She didn't want to tell the teachers at school or any other person because she was afraid that if her stepfather find out about that, he would get made and hit her, or even worse, kill her mother. However, she needed to tell somebody. One morning somebody knocked at the door at Sally's house. It was the police. Sally was so scared, and at the same time mad at Pat because she knew the only person who could have told the police was her best friend. But she knew that Pat did it because she loved her and was afraid something horrible could have happened to her or to her mother. ",33.0

1052," Dear Mr. Robertson, I have heard you organised such a nice programme especially  river trip and museum for our class. I would like to thank you for doing that on behalf of my classmates. By the way, our classmates have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and leisure show. It will show us the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear. In addition, make up and hairstyles shows will take place at the same time. We think it would be a wonderful chance to have a new experience. What is  better,  all students can participate without paying. It takes place at Central Exhibition hall in London. And it starts from 10 to 19 on 14th of March. So we would like to suggest you to put this programme into the morning time on Tuesday instead of  Science Museum and put  science museum into free time on Wednesday. I hope you will consider our suggestion. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Much safer but still at home Our homes have change with many comfortable things compare with the past. As many inventors made lots of things, we can live in good facilites houses: But do you think no more comfortable homes will be built? Our homes will be different in the way to protect our family from theives. For example, now we have a security safety like a bell or button. But in the future, we'll use our eyes or finger prints through the special space to enter inside. That is, our security system will be much stronger. On the other hand, what migh still be the same is to have good places to take a rest at home, such as a beautiful garden, a small terrace. Because it is a instinct that people prefer comfortable place and want to take a rest in a peaceful place. To conclude, while our homes in the future will be much safer than before, they will still have good spaces for us to be at home. ",25.00
224," To the manager of the Circle Theatre. I am PINAR xxx. One week ago I watched your show. I was so disappointed because I didn't find what I expect at your show. The first thing that dissapoint me was the starring. I expected to see Danny Brook because at the paper that you have given to me it wrote that Danny Brook came but there was a different actor. Then you wrote that it start at 19.30 but it started at 20:15. You wrote that discounts  available but they are not available. You wrote that ""visit our restaurant after the show"" so I didn't eat my supper, to eat at your restaurant. but the reastaurant was closed because the show started  20:15 and finissed at 00.15 and the restaurant was opened until 00.00. Finally you wrote that  ""your perfect evening out"" but after all this problems how would you expect the to have a perfect evening out. After all this problems I became dissappointed. Because that was only a week holiday in London. If you would give me some of my money back that would be a great excuse for the loss of time and my dissopointness.  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't good at keeping secrets. I know that before but I thought that he may change. I trusted him and told  about the reality. It was about Marine, who was our clase friends. The reality was  Marine's parents are not her real parents, they found her in their houses garden. They try so many things to find her family for one year they did everything to find her family but they couldn't find . In this one year they spend most of their time with Marine and they loved her so much and they want to be her parents. When Marine was three years old a man came to their house and sad that he is Marine's father and  wont to take her. and he added that he leave Marine because her mother was dead two days after Marine's birth. and the police thought Marine's father did this so they put him on prison he had nobody that he can give marry  so he leave her on their garden. The Marine's real father want her back but the other cuples didn't want to give her  because they loved Marine so much. They give a lot of money to Marine's real father to take her. After that Marine's father take the money & left her. The cuples couldn't say the reality to Marine because they were afraid of losing her. After I told the reality the Pat. Pat said this the Marine. Marine said to Pat that ""I had knowed that because I talked with my real father every month but my parents doesn't know that because I am waiting for them to say me the reality"". ",25.0
271," Mr John Smythe, I'm writing to tell you about the horrible evening I had on Friday. I was very excited with the idea of going to the theatre, but it didn't work out as I thought it will. First of all the starring actors were supposed to be Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, Tina did act, but Danny Brook was replaced by an awful actor whose name I don't recall. Second of all, the play was suposed to start at 19:30, but it started at 20:15. I'm not used to waste my time sitting on a chair waiting, I do have better things to do with it. Another thing I want to complain about, is that your advertised that discounts were available, but there wasn't any discount at all. To finish my ""marvelous"" evening, I wanted to eat at your restaurant, but it was closed and no reason was given. As I didn't have a ""perfect evening out"", I think I have the right to ask for my money back. I hope you understand. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Pat's story Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Now you've probably asking yourself what does it mean, well, now I'm going to explain it to you. Two years ago in this school, Pat and I used to be best friends. We used to tell everything to each other. I was having some family problems, so my marks were getting down and down. Pat was worried, she didn't know what to do. One day she looked me in the eyes with a sharp deep look, Never have I seen such a deep look: and asked me what was happening and I told her as I always used to. That afternoon she visited me and told me a plan she had designed to make my marks rise. It consisted in stealing the school list from the computer, in other words, hack  the school software. I thought it was a great idea, so I stole about ten tests we were planned to do. Pat couldn't stand the pressure of the ""crime"" so she told the school directors that I stole the tests. I was punished, nearly expelt, but Pat didn't receive any punishment. I never accused her of lying, and I you ask me why, I really don't know. ",34.0
287," Dear Sir/Madam, I saw the musical show in your advertisment in my holiday. I was disappointed with it. I would ask you to my money back. First of all, I was really looking forward to seeing Danny Brook but actually, starting was not Danny Brook but another person. Besides her acting didn't make me satisfied. Secondly,  starting time was not 19:30 but 20:15. Because of it, I was waited for a long time, Also, there was no system that ticket can be discounted. Finally, I went to  restaurant in your theatre but it was closed, I couldn't eat anything. That's  nub of my complaints. Thus I spent  terrible time - it was  waste of time. I'm expecting for your reply soon. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  'Fashion of the future, I think after 100 years, at least something will change in the point that design, material, color, etc. If I pick up the example,  Kimono (Japanese traditional cloth) will wear on not only Japan but also  another countries in generally. Also it will be only wear but its design, shape might take in casual cloth. If it came true, imagination to make cloth would bigger and could think various design and format. By one country's traditional cloth taking in those of another country, it can born different type and new kind of fashion. On the other hand, there might vanish  personality (character) of each country. However, thinking way that simple is the best will not change. Also, comfortable cloth for person will maintain in the future. I guess the good things will not change forever. ",16.0
1111," Dear Mr Robertson, Regarding the programme you have organised, it is  great ideas everything that you have planed, but I would like to suggest to you something that the students saw in an advertisement. It is  good start to go on  sightseeing by bus on Monday morning,  we can se all  famous buildings in a few hours. It's seems relaxing to go to Greenwich in the afternoon looking though the river. The idea about going to  science museum is fantastic, I read about the museum,  it is really interesting in science history. After all morning in the Museum, it is wonderful and on tuesday doing some shops, whereas the student have another idea for tuesday. On Wednesday after  viseted  national Art Gallery, we can have a chat about ours next holiday at the free time in the afternoon. The advertisement that  students saw is about a fashion show, but to go to the show you will need cancel the tour on tuesday and add the show, because the show is from 10.00 to 19.00. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Freedom! Nowadays the main attroction in the newspapers and  television is  private life of famous people. It is really interesting how people like knowing  famous people life. Without someone famous know, photographs take pictures secretly,  try to get money on it. Sometimes being famous can get stress,  everywhere they go there are people around them, especially journalists, trying to ask millions  questions. Famous people deserve to have freedom to do whatever they want, but it is quite difficult to do thing in a public places, because nobody like  famous politicians or film stars without asking questions. On the whole, to be rich and famous don't always bring happeness, whereas the majority of the population wish they were rich and famous. ",21.00
630," Dear Mrs Ryan, I received your letter which says I won the first prize in your competition - two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. I apreicate it and I thank you a lot that you have chosen me as a winner. I acxepted it and I want to inform you that I can travel only on July because I have booked my anual leave  that period. Also, I prefer to stay in tents because I have memories from my childhood. Every years my parents used to sent me for holidays at Camps on the mountains so I would like to stay for a while in the same  accommodation, and environment. Also, I prefer swimming and painting. I started to learn how to swim when I was 7 years old. My parents brought me to the sea side every weekend so I was used to be inside the water all the seasons. I have taken part in races twice in my life, where I was successful. Also, I like painting from  young age, and I have taken part in a public exhibition, where I won the first prize. I would like to ask how much money I should have with me, where can I keep them? What about the clothes, you don't mention anything . Do I need something special or  ordinary clothes? Yours sincerely   [SEP]  Dear Kim, I would like to write about my experience that I had, when I enjoyed helping at a pop concert in my neighbourhood. I am a member in the council team so I decided to help them at a pop concert that was organized in the last month. I helped them to prepare the room for the bads and I decorated the place for the singers. Also, I assisted them to choose the right instruments and to test them. It took a long time to testifite the speakers and the microphones. Unless this preparation, I also took part to the concert. I helped them to  the music and to the songs. It was a quite difficult assiment but I got  very good experience. I understood it when the concert had finished. The audients was excited and I cannot discribe my happyness. It was some thing that I didn't expect. Also, it happen  first time in my life. I still have the sound of the music in my ears and the voices of the young people who were accompaning our songs. I enjoyed  very much and I want to tranfere my enjoyment to you though this letter. yours sincerely ",29.0
243," Sir, I'm writing to you because I want you to give the money back for your  ""London's newest and best musical show: Over the rainbow"", presented in the Circle Theatre. In fact, unlike the perfect evening out that you promised on your advertisement, I had a very disapointing evening. Firstly, I expected to see Danny Brook in the show, but he was replaced by another actor. Why was he not here? Moreover I had to wait forty five minutes to see the beginning of the show. And I hate to wait! There was also the discounts wich weren't available. And to finish, the restaurant was closed, for any reasons you didn't take to us. So I couldn't eat this evening. Hoping you'll satisfy my request.  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. So the surprise we prepared for the Leon's birthday had failed. However, we've started to search an idea for it for one months . In the beginning, I wanted to bring him in my house where everybody would wait for him. But he wanted to stay at his home. So Sigone found the greatest idea. We would pretend to have bought for him a dog. Leon hate dog, and I don't know why. So we had to find a dog that Leon wouldn't recognized. And I found one. I had a friend who had just received a little dog. But he was a Pat's friend too, and Pat explained everything to Leon. No luck. ",28.0
164," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to you for explaining some problems I had when I went to the theatre to see one of your company's musical shows called ""Over the rainbow"". I would like to say that the information given in your advertisement was not true at all. First of all, the main characters had to be Danny Brook an Tina Truelove. I got very disappointed when I discovered Danny Brook was not going to play  and a different actor would play  instead of him. Another problem was  the start of the show. When I finished working I had to hurry up because the show started at 19:30 and it was 19:00. For my surprise, when I arrived to the theatre the show still had not started. All of us, who had paid a lot of money for those tickets, had to wait  long time before the show started, because it started at 20:15! You should review the advertisements you do because you give wrong information. For example, the advertisement said we could buy tickets with discounts, but when I went to buy it your employees told me there were no discounts available. When the show was over I went to have dinner to your theatre restaurant but I found it closed because your company is lacked of employees. In conclusion, what I expected to be ""my perfect evening"", as you said in your advertisement, was a very disappointing evening due to the problems I had. I would like to know if I could have some money back for these problems I have told you . I advise you to pay more attention in your shows and look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible. Yours faithfully, MANUEL SANTOS  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Two days ago I thought I could trust Pat because she was not going to tell anybody our secret, our important secret. I wish I had never told her anything. All began when, three days ago, I was doing  homework in my class. I was alone because Pat had to go with her parents to the cinema. Suddenly, I heard step noises that were getting closer to me. It was Paul, my teacher, who came to see what I was doing there. After a few words which I didn't pay attention to, my teacher went out the class. I was boried, so I decided to follow him to discover where he was going. He was going down the stairs wearing his blue jacket. ""See you tomorrow!"" I cried, but he didn't listen to me. Then, while I was going back to my class I saw he hadn't switched off the light of his room. I went to switch it off. As soon as I entered that room I realised he had forgotten our exams there. I couldn't believe my eyes! The exams we had to do  next day were there. Without thinking it twice, I took one of them and went quickly home. I had to phone Pat to tell her which were the questions of the exam. When I told her this piece of news, she got surprised. We thought we shouldn't tell it anybody else. Next day in the morning, before the exam, we were going to put the exam back with the other exams. But my plan didn't work well. Next day, everybody knew about my great finding because Pat hadn't kept our secret. The problem was that my teacher also knew  it because someone had told him ""the story of the exams"", as he called my big problem. He told me I had done wrong taking the exam but I think the only thing I did wrong was telling Pat my important secret. Next time I will get sure  who I'm telling my secret to. ",36.0
202," Dear Mr. Smith, During my last holiday in London, I was visiting your theatre in order to see ""Over the rainbow"". You wrote some things in your advertisement and I was disappointed that  wasn't true. First you have written that the starring were Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, but the real actors were different. It was a disappointing for me, because this actors were recommended by my friend, because he knows Danny and Tina. You have also written in your advertisement that it would started at half past seven but it started at 20:15! So we had to wait more than a half hour. It wouldn't be mind if the restaurant had pressed in order to eat or drink something, but it was closed, and it hadn't also opened after the show, because the waitress had to clean up the theatre room. Over these the tickets were not discount available as you have written  in your advertisement. So it wasn't a perfect evening for me and I think about it, if I can have my money back. If it's possible, please write back. Sencerely ...  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets and so his hole schoole knew from Sara's experience. Sara was a very good puple. She didn't learn a lot but she knew all  important things. She was a very nice person and she helped always if somebody need her help. One day she had to make the shopping for her mother. She had to buy a lottery-ticket and other things for her. After she had done this she went home, but she didn't buy the ticket because she thought there aren't no change  to win. She spent this  only for a magazin. After she came home her mother was sitting in front of the TV and looked after the lottery-numbers. Suddenly she jumped out of her armchair and shouted: ""I have won the jack-pot"". Sara was out of breath and after  she had told her mother, she hadn't bought the ticket. Her mother get angry but some hours later she was friendly again. Sara couldn't understand the fact, that she didn't do the right thing. She had earn a lot of money, so she would be more careful with doing things . ",26.0
604," June 13th, 2000 Dear Mrs Ryan, I am very glad for receiving such a wonderful surprise,  that I have won first prize. What a lovely opportunity to go to America! About the information you asked me for, the most suitable month for me to travel would be July, since it is when I am free for traveling due to I won't have classes at school by that time. In the matter of accommodation I'd rather prefer  log cabins, because I consider them better for resting and  know people. I also want to mention that it's great you have so many activities. The ones I consider I'm good at are painting and photography. I love nature and I'd like to record the Californian landscapes. I have something I'd like to ask you. Do I have to take any special clothes with me? How warm is California in those days? Another thing, should I have to take my camera with me for the activity at the Camp? I'd appreciate any further information you can give me. Looking forward to your repply. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  June 13th, 2000 Dear Kim, It was quite nice to hear from you and your family in the last letter you sent me. Hope everybody is fine. And, yes! I helped my friend Jane at the concert! It was such a wonderful experiece! When Jane asked me to help her with the organisation of the publicity and specially with the inverviews, I just couldn't believe it. You know that I love going to concerts, but being  beging of all the show and in the staff as a member, was something I was always interested in. I never imagined how many people is involved in the organization ! In the area of publicity we were about 50 guys, all of us investigating, calling to radio stations, organizing the reporters, specifying where the press would be for the interview that took place afterwards... yet, it was an incredible satisfation when everything finished just fine! Wish you were there! But, I heard you went on vacations to Bermuda. Cool! How was it? You have to tell me everything! Looking forward to hearing from you. Love, XXX ",34.0
375," 17th June 2000 Dear Sir or Madam, About two weeks ago, I went to London for a week holiday. While there I saw your advertisement for the show ""Over the rainbow"" and decided to go. I was looking forward to a great evening, but much to my surprise, it was not exactly the case: there were no discounts available,  as it was mentionned in the advertisement; the show started 45 minutes late; I was then very disappointed to see that Danny Brook was replaced by someone else. After the show was over, it was not possible to visit the theatre restaurant, as it was closed that day. I am very sorry to say it was definitely not a perfect evening out, and I am therefore asking you  a refund of the amount I paid, or part of it. You will find the receipt enclosed. Yours faithfuly,  [SEP]  Modern technology is affecting my daily life a lot, I can even say  changed it. I will take the exemple of the use of the internet. I use it on a daily basis for many different reasons: I don't write letters to my friends anymore, and wait weeks before receiving answers, I just send an electronic mail through the internet and the person received it within seconds. I don't need to go to the stores anymore, if I don't want to: I can just stay at home and buy almost everything through it: books, video tapes, clothes and even groceries. It is also possible to read the news or play games. I also have the possibility of making new friends: I can connect to a special site which will enable me to virtually meet people. ",38.0
552," Dear Mrs. Ryan, Thank you for your letter letting me know that I've won first prize in your competition. It came as a nice surprise. I would like to let you know that I can only travel in July because that is the only time I can take leave from work. I would prefer to stay in the log cabins as I would be afraid of insects or any crawling animals if I have to stay in the tent. For activities choices, I would like to choose Tennis and swimming. I used to play Tennis at tournament level and now I play it for enjoyment instead. Swimming is my best way of excercise and keeping fit. I've a few questions to ask. Since all accommodation and travel costs are paid for, Are there any other expenses that I have to pay? How much money I should have with me in order to cover all other expenses? Furthermore, what type of clothes I should bring? I would be grateful if you could let me know the above information as soon as possible. Thank you once again for giving me  good news! Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  I find shopping is the most time consuming. If I want to buy a nice pair of shoe, I'll have to go into a city centre and browse around from shops to shops until I find the shoes I like. If I'm not lucky enough to find one, then I'll have to take a train trip to a larger shopping places such as London. Whilst in London; I'll be facing crowds and people will be rushing everywhere. To walk around London streets looking for a pair of shoe can definitely be a tiring task. As I'm a compulsive buyer, I'd probably ended up buying other things as well. At the end of the day, I would not only be carrying  pile of shopping bags but also trying to squeeze in between other passengers on the train on my way home. By the time I get home, I would be completely exhausted. As you can see, shopping is not always enjoyable. ",33.0

347," Dear Sir/Madam, I recently had a holiday in London and had been to your musical show 'Over the Rainbow' but found it very disappointing. It is said that the singers are Danny Brook and Tina Truelove in the advertisement. However, there was a different unknown actor in that. The show started later at 20:15 which was very different in '19.30' as shown. There was no discount at all which is in contrast with 'Discounts Availabe'. After the show, I wanted to have something in the theatre restaurant and found it was closed because of no reason. The real show on it owns is really very different to what are mentioned in the advertisement. I am unsatisfied and would like to ask for some money back. Please would you also change the advertisement to the level of the actual facts. Thank you for your attention. Yours faithfully,   [SEP]  What will clothes be like 100 years from now? It is a very hard thing to predict. The fashion of nowaday clothings is just keep on changing. Although some may appears again after  few years different styles are developed. For the fashion of the future, I think it depends on the people's own personalities and  develope their own styles which suits them the most. They can wear different kinds of clothing, like they design for themselves or those like history can wear those of victorian time and in different countries. For the colours, I think the metalic colours, especially silver, will be the most popular. As different kinds of farbics will be invented & the clothings will never be just cotton as always been seen. Maybe paper can also be a farbic use for make clothings and for those who like to wear new clothes everyday. They can be thrown away after wearing it and  light enough to be carried around whenever you want to change  your wearing. ",23.0

It was about his private problem, related  his friendship in  whole school. If he had told everybody, J would have been blamed by  whole school. But he forgot it and told his friends. Actually it was not on his purpose. But sometimes, Pat mistakes to speak someone's secrets. Though it was not on his purpose, it makes his friends leave him. They can't believe him. Pat also regrets about his speaking. It could be difficult for him to change himself. It is like his one of bad habbits.

WHEN THE ROBBER UNDERSTOOD HE COULD BE DISCOVERED  HE SAID ""IF YOU DON'T KEEP THE SECRET I WILL KILL YOU"". PAT, AS HE ALWAYS DID, COULDN'T KEEP THE SECRET, EVEN IF HE WAS SCARED. EVENTUALLY THE ROBBER WAS CAUGHT BY THE POLICE, AND FOR HIS BRAVE AND HONESTY HE HAD A LOT OF FRIENDS. ",26.0
185," Dear Sir, I am writing to complain about the arrangements for the musical show ""Over the Rainbow"". I was spending some days in London and enjoyed a lot the idea of seeing this show. All my disappointment started when we noticed that there were no discounts available for the tickets, but as we wanted to see Danny Brook's performance, we decided to buy them anyway. We got really upset when we realized he was being substituted. The show was scheduled for 19:30 but it only started at 20:15. Besides the boredom of having waited for forty-five minutes, we were not allowed to visit the restaurant after the show, since it was already closed by the time the show finished. As it was not our perfect evening out, as you suggested in your advertisement, we would like to know if it would be possible for us to get a refund. I look forward to your response. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Best Detective Stories of Agatha Christie Dear Ted, I'm writing to tell you about a great book I've just finished reading, and which I'm sure you would like to read too. Its name is ""Best Detective Stories of Agatha Christie"", and I really got impressioned with the coherence of the stories. Agatha Christie presents situations that make us break up our minds. The crimes she describes seem so perfect that we brainstorm a lot trying to find out who is the criminal. I thought about you while reading the book because I remembered you have booked a place in a Detective course. I'm sure you'll find this book an interesting object of study. Agatha Christies stories are simple, but very well written, and, as I told you, very coherent. It's estimulating to read them. One of the stories will be read on the radio next week. I'm sure that if you listen to it you will start reading the book immediately, and find out there  many challenges for your new carreer. I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon. Best wishes, ",33.0
43," Dear Jane Clark Hello! My name is Yuna Kimber who attended this annual International Arts Festival. I'd like to say something that I felt during the festival, and give my opinions that would be helpul for you to prepare for the next festival to you. First of all, I appreicate you for organizing such an exciting festival.  It was a great idea, and I enjoyed myself to this festival so much. By the way, according to the advertisement, lots of stars and artists from around the world were supposed to be invited for the festival, but I was able to meet them just from only six countries. And another thing is that some concert halls were too small, so when I went there for Jazz and rock concerts it was so crowded, and during the concerts people felt stuffy. I hope you'll get much bigger concerts hall next year. On the other hand,  plays and films were excellent. I expect that much more various kinds of plays and films will be on next year. Finally, I'd like to mention  reasonably-priced weekend ticket.  It was brillient, because if I had to pay  all things each I wouldn't have attended it, because it was very expensive for me.  Thank you very much about that. I hope it will be helpful and useful for you. Bye for now Faithfully yours  [SEP]  Long time ago, there were two brothers, whose parents were dead.  Their parents were rich, so when they passed away they left a lot of money. By the way, the elder brother, Nolbu was a so greedy man. He didn't want to share the money with his brother, Hungbu so he took all of the money, and said to Hungbu to go away from the house without anything. Hungbu had nothing but his twelve family. But, even if he was so poor, he was so good and had a lot of affection about the people who were much poorer than his family, so he looked after them. But, Nolbu always made people annoyed, and enjoyed other people's misfortune. One cold day, Hungbu saw a bird that had a broken wing, so the bird couldn't fly to the warmer county during the winter.  He cured the bird to fly with love, and the bird was able to fly. The following year, when the bird returned  his house, he gave him a message.  It was a kind of map that showed the place for a lot of money which robbers hid. Therefore, Hungbu became much richer than Nolbu, and he lived happily with the money helping the poor. People belive that the bird was sent by heaven. This story happened a long time ago. ",23.00
913," Dear Madam, I was very happy to know that I have won the first prize in your competition and it will be a good opportunity for me to go to the U.S.A. If it is possible, I would like to travel in July. I will be working until the end of June and I am going to start university in August. I would prefer to sleep in a tent, because, in my opinion, it is easier to make friends and I like camping as well. I have chosen photography and climbing for  activities. I am a beginner in photography but I am really interested in . I have a medium level  in climbing and I would like to climb the Californian mountains. Can you tell me how much money I have to take, if I have to take winter clothes and if it is possible to rent a car there. Thank you for this opportunity. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  I like shopping. Some people when they are tired relax  spleeping, reading a book or watching television but not me. Walking along the crowded streets of my city is my way of relaxing. I have been working in a shop for a long time and I have noticed that I am not the only one in this case. There were always, at the end of the afternoon, some well-dressed women coming from their offices and they just spent one hour in the shop whithout buying anything. However it is true that shopping is not always enjoyable for example before Christmas or during some special salles. In these periods of the year, the supermarkets and the shops are full of stressed adults and tired children trying to walk in a warm and noisy place. In conclusion, you have to know when and where to shop quietly but in my opinion spending money in a crowded shop is the most enjoyable thing in the world. ",34.0
62," Dear Madam, I'm writing to You in order to express my feelings about the International Arts Festival. I spent two days there, and I think it was the best Arts Festival I have ever been at. I also hope, that the festival could be even better next year. The great idea of making it ""international"" was unfortunately not brought to life, because the artists (mentioned to be ""from around the world"") were from only six countries. Maybe the eason for that is very simple: lack of money? It would explain, why some concert halls were simply too small - you just couldn't afford bigger ones. On the other hand, the wide range of plays and films to choose  impressed me  most. I thank you for organizing it, and hope to see more next year. I also thank you for the excellent idea of  one ticket for all events, which allowed me to see all the things I was interested in. My suggestion for next year's festival is simple - please make it a few days longer! Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Dear Friend, Thank you for your last letter - I was very pleased to receive it. If you really want to hear about school rules in my country, I'll try to write about them in a nutshell. We do not have many school rules, and the teachers are rather liberal. We don't have to wear any special uniforms on signs of our school. Some rules are really simple: we must be at school on time, and we must not disturb others during the classes. We are not allowed to smoke cigarettes or drink alcohol of course! In winters we are to change our shoes. It may sound funny, but mud, gravel and snow lying on the school's floors is not a nice sight, so we change our schoes without questioning that rule. I am also used to write exams which are in polish schools very often. At home I don't have many rules either. I must wash the dishes from time to time (I sometimes try to avoid this unpleasant duty) and clean our house. I don't think there is anything I'd like to change. I'm very pleased with my situation and I hope you are pleased with yours! Your faithfully, ",37.00
1001," Dear Mrs Ryan, I am writing to answer to your letter in which you told me I won first prize in our competetion, which is two weeks , I was very happy with this result since I did not think I could win. First of all I would like to tell you that I will be able to travel only in July because in the other months I will be too busy with my work. In the second place I add that I would prefer an accomodation in a tent, even though it is not very comfortable, because I want to put myself to the test by living in a condition I am not used to. Besides this, in connexion with the activities we will have the chance to do, I would like to inform you that I choose swimming and tennis because I am quite good at both, especially at tennis. In addition to this I would like to ask you which kind of clothes and how much money it is necessary to have, since I am undecided about it not knowing the cost of life in California. I look forward to hearing from you soon, Yours Sincerely, Marino Rizzo  [SEP]  The aim of this report is to suggest which activities of our daily life at school shoud be filmed to give the other students the idea of what we usually do not only during the lessons but also the rest of the time. Most of the students agree in saying that  two are the main features of our daily life at school which should be filmed: it would be very funny to dwell on us working and speaking together without the help of the teacher to show our efforts and sometimes successful and sometimes ridiculous and also to film some amusing moments we spent waiting for the teacher. A little percentage, on the contrary, said it would be very useful to film the teacher when she is explaining us something important, to give the idea of the real life in our classroom. which is the most.

191," Dear manager, I am writing this letter to inform you that the advertisement for the musical show was with wrong information. Firstly, the actors were different from the ones written in the advertisement which was very disappointing for me. Furthermore, according to the advertisement I was supposed to begin at 14.30 and 19.30 but it started at 20.15. Moreover, when I bought the tickets I was expecting discounts  available, however, there were no discounts available and the tickets were more expensive than the price written in the advertisement. When the show ended I went to visit the theatre restaurant I could not get in because it was closed as the chef of the restaurant was not there. I did not have a perfect evening out and I would like to have my money back. I am looking forward to hearing from you as soon as possible. Sincerely,  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed your daily life? Technology has changed our life forever. Nowadays life is much easier than in the old days. Firstly, we can cook our meals  an electrical stove or in a microwave and it takes just a few minutes to get ready. We do not need to lit  fire in order to cook as in the old days. Secondly, the doctors have found the cure for many diseases and many operations have been done in less time and in a painless way, by using especial machines doctors have be able to save more lives than in the past. For those who need to travel in order to make business with other people abroad can fly by plane and arrive in their destination safely or have their problems solved through telephone. To sum up, technology has been a great help to all of us. In the future, it will be able to help people even more since it has been increasing its capacity day after day. ",30.0
1030," DECEMBER 12TH PRINCIPAL MR. ROBERTSON DEAR SIR, I WANT TO THAK YOU FOR PREPARING SUCH A GOOD PROGRAMME FOR US AND ESPECIALLY FOR TAKING US TO THE RIVER TRIP TO GREENWICH. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF THERE IS ANY CHANCE OF CHANGING THE PROGRAMME BECAUSE WE HAVE FOUND A VERY INTERESTING ACTIVITY TO DO ON TUESDAY 14 MARCH. IT CONSISTS ON VISITING THE LONDON FASHION AND LEISURE SHOW IN THE CENTRAL EXHIBITION HALL. I THINK IT'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE GREATER USE OF OUR KNOWLEDGE OF  ENGLISH LANGUAGE. ON THE OTHER HAND, WE COULD LEARN THE DIFFERENT WAYS TO GET TO THE CENTRAL EXHIBITION HALL. I SUGGEST THAT WE SHOULD GO TO THE NATIONAL ART GALLERY IN THE MORNING AND INSTEAD OF HAVING THE AFTERNOON FREE WE COULD GO TO THE FASHION AND LEISURE SHOW. I WILL BE WRITING ANXIOUSLY FOR YOUR RESPONSE. YOURS FAITHFULLY  [SEP]  (FAMOUS PEOPLE, SUCH AS POLITICIANS AND FILM STARS, DESERVE TO HAVE A PRIVATE LIFE WITHOUT JOURNALISTS FOLLOWING THEM ALL THE TIME) FAMOUS PEOPLE SUCH AS SINGERS, FILM STARS, ETC ARE ALWAYS THE CENTRE OF ATTENTION. AS SOME OF THEM ARE CONSIDERED IDOLS, THEIR FANS WANT TO KNOW HOW THEY ACT IN THEIR PRIVATE LIVES, WITH THEIR FAMILY OR FRIENDS. AS A RESPONSE TO THIS DEMAND OF INFORMATION, JOURNALISTS FOLLOW FAMOUS PEOPLE DAY AND NIGHT IN MANY DIFFERENT WAYS, FOR EXAMPLE, CHASING THEIR CARS, TAKING PHOTOGRAPHS OR BREAKING INTO THEIR HOUSES WHILE THEY ARE ON HOLIDAYS. THIS SITUATION AFFECTS FAMOUS PERSONAL LIVES BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE  PRIVACY THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THAT, ALTHOUGH THEY ARE FAMOUS, THEY ARE JUST NORMAL PEOPLE THAT DESERVE TO HAVE A PRIVATE LIFE WITHOUT JOURNALISTS AND FANS FOLLOWING THEM ALL THE TIME, AND ON THE OTHER HAND PEOPLE HAVE TO LEARN TO RESPECT THE FAMOUS  RIGHT TO KEEP THEIR PERSONAL LIVES IN SECRET. IN MY OPINION FAMOUS PEOPLE ARE BEING OBLIGED TO PAY A PRICE FOR BEING FAMOUS THAT IN SOME CASS, COSTS MORE THAN THEY DESERVE TO PAY. ",28.00
1238," Dear Mrs Smith, I'm writing in reply to your letter in which you asked me for help. I hope I will be able to give you the information you need for the group of students who are coming to the conference. Firstly, the Palace Hotel is waiting for you and your students. The best way to get from there to the college where the conference will take place is simply to walk. Actually, the college is situated 500 meters away from the Hotel. As you know, the conference will be followed by a party. It will begin at 7 p.m and last until late in the evening. You don't need to worry about what you should wear to this event. In fact, the purpose of the end-of-conference party is to relax after a busy day, therefore you and your students can put jeans and sport shoes on. To conclude, we decided to organize a guided tour by coach, as you have an afternoon free before your plane takes off. I hope the international student conference will help   to know each other better and that it will be a success. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Sir or Madam, I'm writing in reply to your letter in which you asked me  information on an interesting building to visit. There is so many places of interest in Lausanne, but I think that the Olympic Museum is the most notable for the following reasons: The Olympic Museum dates from the 19th century and is the biggest in Europe. It shows all the different sports men have been doing since the first Olympic Games in Greece. You can see the evolution of sports and understand why changes gradually have been done to improve them. You can admire every kind of equipments you need to do any particular sport. You will be informed about the story of sport in general and about the new technologies which are used nowaday n high competitions. The museum is near the city center and is accessible by bus or walking. It will takes you an afternoon to visit it and then you can enjoy a drink or a meal in the restaurant on the third floor,  well-known for being one of the best establishment in Lausanne. I hope my recommendations will help you in the choice of a building to visit. Yours faithfully, ",36.00

Then the show was suppost to start at 19.30 hours but it started at 20:15, more than half an hour later. I cuold read in the advertisment that there were some discounts available but there werent.

168," Dear Madam and Mister I am writing to you about your theatre: 'over the rainbow'. I went to a performance and I am very disappointed. Firstly, your advertisement said the actor would be Danny Brook, but it was not. It played an other one who played very bad. Secondly, the musical should start on 19.30, but we had to wait until 20.15! It was boring that nothing happend  such a long time on the stage. Did you know that you have no discounts on your tickets? I could not believe that. Why do you write things on your advertisement when nothing is true? And finally, I would  had my dinner after this disappointment musical and thougt I  go to 'Theatre restaurant'. But how can it be, it was closed! This are too many negatives points for one evening. I am afraid, but I want my money back. I hope you do not disappoint my in this point. Your faithfully Pica Landen  [SEP]  'Fashion of the Future'! This is not a tabu  by me and my friends. We have discussed about it a lot of times. I think it is important and necessary to think about it, because our children will live in the future. I have dout when somebody said, that the fashion of the future would be different. I think it is very difficult to change the clothes and the fashion so much again. We have so many kind of clothes and fashion behind our old generations. Maybe, the skirts will be shorter and the colours brighter, the shoes moderner so that you can not walk in them anymore. Maybe in 500 years, some people will live on the Mars and then, they  have to wear other kind of clothes. But I don't think this clothes are going to be a fashion on the earth. They just look funny!

Although the world of computers will develop day by day, I lively hope we (human being) could mantain our personality of seeing things. ",22.0

As I didn't expect to be successful, I am very happy about this result. I would now like to answer the information you requested. Firstly, I would be pleased if I could travel in July as I already booked this month as a holiday at work. Besides, I would prefer to stay in a tent since I have never had the exciting experience  to sleep in the middle of the nature. I am especially glad about the activities offers, in particular the sports facilities because I was spezialised in sport for my A-levels and intend to become a sport teacher. I have been playing Basketball for many years but I would appreciate to improve my skills, in particular the ball-handling. Furthermore I am really keen on swimming and can therefore hardly await having the possibility to learn the butterfly as a new style since I am already perfect in  crawl. I know I have already asked a lot but there is one more thing I need to know which kind of clothes will be appropriate and how much money will I approximately need? I trust I mentioned all the requested details and am now looking forward to hearing from you to arrange the exact date of departure. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  June, 13th 2000 Dear Kim, how are you doing? Thanks for your latest letter - I was really happy about your news! Here, everything is as usual: School, studying, eating, sleeping - but did I tell you about my latest job? I helped at a pop concert of a newcomer group and you can't imagine how exciting it was! First of all, I helped selling tickets and drinks and there I realized how bad my maths is - I took such a long time to give back the change! But at the end I handled it almost automatically. Before the performance I introduced the spectators to their seats and then a instructor showed me how to lead the spotlights. I really had butterflies in my stomach when I was responsible for the lightening! It was marvellous! But the cherry on the cake was that I met one of the handsome singers back stage! He asked me what I was doing and so on and finally invited me for his next concert! Of course I agreed - I wouldn't want to miss the chance to gain experience while having fun! Perhaps I could help regularly in the lightening area - it would help me for my studies of photography. What do you reckon? I can hardly await your reply! Lot's of Love, ",36.0

My mother suggested to come here because one of her brothers was established here and he could help us. I hadn't known all of us (my uncle, my aunt and my beautiful cousin) up to that day. My uncle, called Paul, offered us to stay with his family up to we could build our house.

Allreggards  [SEP]  School days As known, every body have to spend all the childhood and youth at the school, because  that everybody have a similar daily life such as, wake up, got to the school, study and the best, meet all the friends. A survey has been done, and the issue is, wich subjects (lessons) and activities the students thinks are the most enjoyables. Someone says it is maths, pratical, usefull  but the majority says it is boring, unless you're chose a job which charges all your math's knowledge  as accounting, otherwise you can use a calculator or a computer. The majorite has chosen History, which means a big journey around the world, either at the Roman life style, or in the midle age, when a revolution happened with deaps and new lands. People must get some rest often, and as a result they look forward  some happiness at the free time such as, party, games, and every one loves party , it should have been filmed. At all schools there is a similar daily life wich must be filmed, this is a important part of our life, wich is full of emotions in development. ",28.0
1021," Dear Mr Robertson I am writing, on the name of all my English class, to thank you for the opportunity you give us to spend three days in London, but also to suggest some modifications in the programme. The programme you has already organised is very interesting, especially because it provides a good combination between cultural visits and more relaxed activities. But, in another hand, we have seen an advertisement for the ""London Fashion and Leisure Show"", which includes a range of different stands. The only day we can attend to this show is the Tuesday 14th March from 10 am to 7 pm in the Central Exhibition Hall. We are really interested in visiting this unhabitual show and the main advantage is that the entry is free for students. In conclusion, I suggest that we go directly after the Science Museum to the show. We all agree that we have enough time in Wednesday for shopping. I hope that you will agree with this suggestion. I am waiting for your answer. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Famous people, such as politicians and film stars, deserve to have a private life without journalists fellowing them all the time Famous people have always been the center of interest for  number of people. Their wedding, their holiday, their new haircut and so on. But do we think enough about the right to have a private life? We can watch this problem from two different points of view. From one side, this people chose to become public people. If we don't want to be in the newspapers, we don't do politics or  movies! But from the other, everybody has the right to have a secret garden, the right to be with his/her family without be disturbed by journalists and photographers. The case of the Princess Diana showed how this problem can reach such extremities. In conclusion, I would say that both parts, famous people and journalists, have to respect some rules. As public people, stars and politicians have to accord some time to their public but fans and press people have to respect their private life and to stay polite and respectful. ",31.00

I would like to travel only in July because I have been working in a bank and I can only go on a holiday in July. I would prefer to stay in a tent because I used to go camping and stay in the tent. Therefore I would like to try some kind of experience. I am interested in tennis but I am not so good  tennis player. However I would like to attend tennis activity. In addition swimming would be  good activity for me. While I was studying at the high school and the university, I was in the swimming team of the school. I would like to ask you about clothes and the money. Could you tell me what kind of clothes I should bring? When I go there, can I use  credit card or should I have cash? I look forward to your answer. Yours sincerely,   [SEP]  I think all people like shopping. When you ask some people to learn their opinions about shopping they can tell you they don't like shopping but I suppose it is not true. For example me, when someone asked me about shopping I would say that I hadn't liked it. However now if someone asks me the same question my answer will be ""yes, I like it"". When people hear this word shopping they only think about to go  some stores and try  new clothes or shoes and search for their size and so on. They don't think about other kind of shopping which are liked by themselves. Maybe they like shopping on  internet or window shopping  doesn't matter what kind of shopping they like. There are a lot of shopping style on the world I am sure everybody prefer one of them. In my opinion, even though people say shopping is not always enjoyable, there are always some fun you can find. You only need to discover what you like, and how you can have fun with shopping. ",25.0
506," Dear Sir/Madam I have visited your theater and I was very dissapointed because of the number of reasons. I've read your advertisment and in reality to what was written there was different. There was no Danny Brook but instead of him  was a different actor and I'm very dissapointed about it because I'm his fan. The show started much later, on 45 minutes later than it should be so I was late for the bus. There were no discounts availible so I overspended the money. The theater restaurant was closed for no reason availble to me. It was a realy bad evening and because of it could you possibly give  my money back? Because it was just a waste of money to go to your show. Yours Faithfully Vaisili Solatov  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. But when I came to this school a few months ago I didn't know this. We are in the same maths set so I met him rather soon. He was one of the first people who I get know. After a few days he was already my best friend. Everything was going perfectly befor last month when I met a girl from the other school. Her name was Marine. I saw her as a perfect girl with who I fallen in love with. So one day she offered to me to come to her house at night and to do so I had to run away from our boarding house and that was illigal. I had decided to go. So I woke up at 2 o'clock in the morning and climed out of the window. Unfortunately for me Pat at the time went to  toilet and saw me. So I asked him to keep it in secret. I came back at 6 o'clock in the morning and went to sleep again. Next day my best friend went to  headmaster and told him about me so he gave me a sespend. ",24.0
911," Dear Ms Ryan Helen, thank you for the information, I am glad I've won first prize! I would like to go in July for it's the only month I can choose. In July I'll be on my vacation. As for accomodation I  prefer to live in tents. In my opinion it's the best way of joining nature and fully enjoying it. I'd be glad to choose painting and singing. And I'm good at both because I used to attend to a painting studio when I was at school. I also used to join the school choir and was one of the best sopranos. So I'd be happy to do the activities on two reasons. First I am good enough at both of them. Secondly I truly love painting and singing. I would like to know what the weather is like in California in July to be aware of what clothes I should take. Another thing I am interested in is general information of prices in the USA. I would greatly appreciate your soonest answer. Yours sincerely E. Sidorov.  [SEP]  I enjoy shopping like any woman. It is amazing and sometimes amuzing how charming and strong the spell of luxurious supermarkets and cosy little shops is. And still even this strong spell can be easily shattered. Who can prevent me from having a good,  probably not for my purse, time in the magic world of shopping? The assistant of evil power which frustrates the long-looked-forward-to spell is a shop assistant. Or I would rather say he or she might be or might happen to be such. It's all very nice to be met by a helpful assistant with a radiant smile, ready to help you. But sometimes I really get annoyed at his or her, persistent in nature and polite in structure, questions or suggestions. To say nothing about his or her giving advice! I always make my own decisions! Like any human being I am not delighted to feel guilty, especially when I am not. But I do feel ill at ease when I see dissappointed or angry assistants' faces on leaving the magic world without any remembrances of it! ",38.0
1148," Dear Mrs Maria Smith, Thank you very much for your letter. As you asked me in the letter, I am very happy to help you with finding out  details of the conference. The hotel that your group will be staying at is  Palace Hotel. It is reasonably near to the college, so it may be very good to walk from the hotel along  River Thames following  yellow signs on sunny days. If it rains, you can take  bus 54 that stops in front of the college. The end-of-conference party is designed to give  rough ideas about many different cultures. So you will enjoy traditional foods, music, dances and games from all over the world. As a part of this, the leader of each group has to wear a costume of her country. Other members of  groups can wear a normal pretty formal dress. On the last day, I recommend that you will visit the place that is located at the centre of our city. It is about 1000 years old, so I am sure that you will find it fascinating to see it. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Can you imagine your life without any computers at all? Well, I am sure that you can hardly do this unless you are living deep in a forest or in a dessert! If you think about how many computers we use every day and how dependent we are on them, it must be clear  that  invention of computers has certainly had a significant impact on all our lives. For example, all infrastructures such as  transports and power stations are ran using computers government uses them to organise all sorts of things in a country, and all kids of services and businesses such as hospitals and supermarkets use them as essential capitals. In other words, almost all aspects of our lives today rely on computers. So I am sure from this that it is convincing enough to say that invention of computers is really important. From my personal experience, I can also say that a personal computer is also an amazing tool. It improves  productivity of my homework, that is often essay writing, and also it allows me to access to the internet. Since I live abroad, the internet is really useful for me to have a contact with my bestfriend and  to know what is going on in my home country. To sum up, I can say that the greatest ever invention is the invention of computers that has affected both indivisuals and a society as a whole. ",38.00
297," Dear Sir Owing to the bad organisation of the last play that was played in your theatre those last weeks I want to explain you  some incorrect information that I found in your advertisement and as a result of it, all the problems that I had . First of all, I think if you go to a play and you are watching to see your favourite actor playing a good play and then  appears a silly one, who doesn't know what to do, it is disappoint at all. Secondly, all the spectators were waiting  the begining of the play at 19.30 and it started at 20.15 then I would like to know why do you say one time in the advertisement  why do you do what you want. Another thing that I want to know is why you didn't do any discount if it was showed in the advertisement. Maybe, I could be a good way to get spectators but I'm going to comunicate that to my travel office. When the play was finished I was looking for your theatre restaurant but it was closed because like on the paper that was on the door was writen, it was too late. I think, that it wasn't my perfect evening out so I wait to be payed back. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets so she lost all her school friends. All started when she was fifteen, when  started a new course on the institute and met some girls that passed the time they would became her friends. Three years passed and like is normal between friends, she knew a lot of things about them like her friends knew a lot about her When it was time to do the final exam, she became ill and she couldn't do it so  teachers decided to allow her to pass the course because she had a lot of good marks but on the other hand the principal desagreeded with it and didn't give the permision to pass her. She had to repeat that course and all her friends passed and like is usuall  girls from the last course became popular. Pat, to win her new classemates' friendship tell all what she knew about her friends and owing to what Pat said, her friends broke they friendship with Pat because their popularity was damaged. Pat's classmates made the same and Pat finished alone. ",23.0
179," Dear Sir or Madam, With reference to your advertisment regarding the musical show ""Over the rainbow"" I am writing to  with the intention  to give you an impression of our experiences visiting the above mentioned show. We were disappointed to realize that not Danny Brook but a different actor played one of the main characters. Honestly it was a less impressive performance than we had expected. According to your advertisment the play should have started at 19:30. Unfortunately there was an unexplained delay of 45 minutes. The audience had to sit and wait until 20:15. What made the situation worse is that no explanation for the delay was given; not even an apologation. We had been told that discounts to the ticket-prices were possible but at the evening of the show no discounts or special offers whatsoever were offered. After the show we had intended to visit your theatre restaurant which was - to our surprise - closed because of the time delay! So we had to leave hungry and with a certain feeling of frustration and disappointment. Honestly for us it was not that ""perfect evening out"". We would like to ask you if there is any chance  to get our money back of or if you can offer any other alternative for our convenience? We are looking forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully M. S.  [SEP]  ""The old man and the Sea"" Dear Tim, I'm writing to you regarding the radio programme next Saturday where ""The old man and the Sea"" by Earnest Hemingway will be read. I recommend you listen to it! As you know we have already had several discussions about literature and what it can tell or teach us. I suppose you still wonder what the great authors can do for us? Therefore Hemingway is a very good example. He fought in the Spanish Civil war and in World War II  always on the search for answers to questions like ""... what defines a man"", or ""... what happens to us in critical situations"". These experiences influenced him so deeply that he described his feelings in several books. One of the most interesting ones is ""The old man and the Sea"". A story of an old seaman leaving his town to proove that he is still able to catch the biggest fish ever caught. The story describes his feelings, thoughts, fears and emotions during a struggle with a giant deep-sea fish. In the end he wins but before he is able to get back he has to ""sacrifice"" his fish to attacking sharks. So did he finally win or loose? An interesting story - demanding in a way - which can give you an impression of Hemingway's work and what he meant by ""pace under pressure"". I hope you will enjoy it! Please let me know! I'm looking forward to hearing from you. Kind regards M. S. ",36.0
337," Dear Sir: I'm writting this letter to complain about the musical show I saw during my stay in London. This show was supposed to be a perfect event but actually I had a very disappointing evening. First of all I want to say that I'm very keen on Danny Brook who was one of the main reasons why I decided to come. However my favourite actor was not there. How could that happen? I also would like to know why the musical show started at a quarter past eight instead of half past seven. I spent a lot of time waiting for the show to start. I really do understand that problems can always come up but it would not have been a problem for me as long as I had been informed about it. Of course discounts were not available either, and the restaurant where we were supposed to eat afterwards was closed without any explanation at all. So, what should have been a nice evening out came to a nightmare. I guess all my reasons are more than enough to get my money back. Thank you very much: Yours faithfully:  [SEP]  Modern technology has actually changed my life quite a lot. Firstly I would like to talk about computers. A couple of years ago I bought a new computer and I had to learn all about them. Even though it was my first one I managed and I got to know pretty fast the way they work. Now, I'm just fascinated by  Internet and I spent at least half an hour every day surfing the net, visiting lots of webs and getting all kind of information for free. I'm impressed by communications as well. If I want to communicate with a friend in Australia I just have to send him an e-mail which is going to get to my fellow in a  while. Isn't that amazing? I should not forget mobile phones. If I feel like talking to a friend I just have to call him and whereever he is I will be able to get through to him. Several european companies like Nokia or Ericsson are focusing on mobiles and I have been told that in a couple of years it will be possible to send and e-mail either from the computer or from the mobile which is going to be great. Finally I want to explain that three weeks ago I started working for a new company and my job is all about new technologies. I'm extremly happy because not only do I earn a lot of money but also I'm learning a lot. So, as you can see, modern technology has had  influence in my life. ",37.0

And you are staying  the Palace Hotel, which is located in  town Centre. You can take buses or our school buses. It costs forty pence. If you take public buses, it costs more expensive than  school bus. The end-of-conference party is going to start from Seven o'clock. One of our teacher, who will be voted by student is making  speech for one hour. After,  student is making  speech about what he or she have learned. and diner. In my opinion, you should wear normal cloth. I would like to suggest that you should visit building of sixty two which is consisted on  sixty second floor. There are eye-max cinema, museums,  garelty. This is very famous in our city. I hope that my advice will help you. I look forward to hearing soon from you.

592," Dear Mrs. Ryan, I was very pleased to learn that I had won the first prize in your competition! To answer your questions, I'd like to travel only on July, as it is the only moment when I can take my holidays. I'd prefer to sleep in tents rather than log cabins: sleeping in tents seems to correspond to a ""spirit of adventure"" to me, what I particularly like; in the opposite, log cabins are more ""traditional"" and a less interesting experience. I'm very interested in basketball and sailing, which are both team activities. As I was a child, I was very good at basketball, even one of the best of my class. I like playing in  team and deciding quickly what to do next. These reasons are why I'd also like  sailing. Sailing means an ever renewed adventure as you cannot control the atmospherical conditions. Please, don't forget to tell me how much money I need. I think you very much in advance for your kind assistance. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable The first idea about shopping is that buying something will make a pleasure to the buyer and for that reason, will be enjoyable. But this is not always the case: at first, you see a very pretty item which you'd like to try . When you ask to, the seller offen answers that your size is missing. Hopeful, you try to find the same thing in another shop. You ask the seller for your size. His answer is: ""Everything is here, Madam!"" As you understand that you won't get any help, you waste your time looking for the right size. Finally, you find the right one but you don't have enough money. At the time you realise it, you also realise that the shop is closing in five minutes. So, you run to the bank but have to wait for the queue. There is only one minute left! It's your turn and you do as quick as possible. You run back to the shop and get your item. But now, you are very tired and need a good rest! ",32.0
1239," Dear Mrs. Smith, I am writing in reply to your enquiry about this year international conference. The conference will be held at The Palace Hotel on Old Street. There will be signs to follow from  Central train station. The conference is commensing on 31st June 2001 from 10.00-15.00. Light lunch will be provided. After the conference, there will be a relaxing party. There is no dressed-code for the party. However I suggest you could wear the same outfit as you wear for the conference. I have included the local map, there are some ideas at the back of the map. Please let me know if you would like to book one of the city-walk tours, We have arrange spacial discounts for the conference attendance. Personly I recommend the Dicken's tour because it is a good length of walking and very historical. I hope that I have covered all  information you would need and look forward to seeing you. Your sincerely, P.S. Please find the enclosed map.  [SEP]  There are several interesting buildings in the city of London. I believe Liverpool Street Station is at the top  list. The building itself looks grand and elegant. Despite the fact that this building has served half-a million commuters in a day, it  always clean and functional. There are two parts of Liverpool Street Station that make it so interesting  building. The newly decorated section is fairly modern  style with escalators and touched-screen ticket machine. It is also very well linked into the old underground station which it is such a contrast in transformation. The old bit is rather unique and charming. You could really imagine how it looked like in the old day. There is another surprising section in this building. At the far back of the station  is also connected to a spacious well designed pedestrians park. It is a good example of a great architecture that was designed to provide services to the public. Finally, it is in the heart of  city and everyone would be able to find  without doubt. ",32.00
126," Dear Sir/Madam I am writing to complain about the problems  were exist on the musical show. First of all you said that the starring would be Danny Brook but there was not. Another actor took his place. After that, the time that the show should start was 19:30 but it started fortyfive minutes later. People have been started to complain. What about the available discounts. They were not exist. Except of this there  more. After the show I went to the theatre restaurant but it was closed, because the chef of the restaurant was ill. This is not an excuse. You have to excuse me but this was a very disappointing evening. I would like  to return to me my money back. I am very disappointed with you. I did not expect these problems from you. I am waiting  your answer as soon as possible. Yours faithfully   [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. One day Brian, the best friend of Pat told him a secret. An important secret for Brian. He told him, that he was in love with Jane, a girl in their class. Jane was a very good girl and she liked Brian. Pat told this secret to Beth the best friend of Jane. He didn't told  the secret because he wanted to heard Brian but because he wanted to help him. Brian was very shame to ask Jane  in  date. So, Beth, asked Jane if she is in love with Brian and she said that she was. When Pat heart the good news he told to Brian to asked her  in  date and he knew that she will accepted. Brian learm what was happened and at first he was angry with Pat but then he thanked him. Jane and Brian were very happy. Brian and Pat had a lot of arguments about this because Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. ",24.0
1109," Dear Mr Robertson, I am writing on behalf of my class to thank you about the programme you organised for our trip to London. We all think it is a good programme, especially  the fact that it combines leisure and culture. However, we saw an advertisment for ""The London Fashion and Leisure Show"" and we would all like to go and see it. First of all, you might not know what this show is . In fact, it is a big exhibition of the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles. It would be interesting for us to see all that ""live"", rather than on TV. Furthermore, it is a great opportunity for us because the entry is free for students so it will not affect the budget. The show takes place on 14th March from 10 o'clock to 7 o'clock. We all think that it would be most enjoyable to go to the Science museum until about 11 o'clock and then move  to the show. It would be a good idea to leave at about 5 or 6 o'clock so that we can go shopping for a while. We all hope you will be able to find a good solution without causing too much trouble. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Terror in the Alps It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. We had been trapped in the snowy, almost vertical slopes of the ""Tête Blanche"" for more than ten hours by then. We were there, alone, my friend with his broken leg and myself. We had decided to climb that more than 3'700-metre-high mountain near Arolla in Switzerland two weeks beforehand. We had been preparing the trip for several days when we started to climb the mountain, on that 4th of September 1995. It all went as expected and we reached the summit in six hours. However, it started to go wrong after one hour of downhill walking. My friend fell down and badly hit his leg against a rock. We could immediatly see that it was broken. He couldn't move any more and my mobilephone was not able to find a proper network. We were trapped! I finally decided to carry him on my back on the way back to the rescue chalet. It was dangerous because of the steepness of the slope and we risked falling down all the time. However, we would have frozen to death if we had stood where we were. After ten more exhausting hours of walking we finally reached the chalet, from which we were able to call a helicopter. We were safe! ",38.00
1062," Dear Mr Robertson, I am writing  you in relation to our next programme in London from 13th March to 14th March. First at all, it is a pleasure to say that the programme which you so kindly have prepared is very interesting, especially the visit to the National Art Gallery on Wednesday. On the other hand, our class has recently read an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show which takes place during our visit to London, on Tuesday 14th. This show is a good opportunity to know the latest fashions in several topics like make up, Hairstyles and leisure and sports wear. We think that it could be a great chance in order to know British fashion and probably it would give us good information for improving our studies. We would like to know if it could be possible to introduce a little change in our programme. Our question is: instead of going to the shopping on Tuesday, in the afternoon, could we go to the London Fashion and Leisure Show? I hope you will consider our suggestion. I look forward to hearing your reply. Yours sincerely, Classroom 5  [SEP]  How will be our future homes? Believe it or not, our lives are changing and becoming more complicated every day. The reason of all of this things is the impressionable introduction of the ""new technologies"", such as Computers,  Internet or WAP technologies. Of course, this new facilities will be introduced at home. Now, it is already possible to send our shopping list by the computer, and this opption, in the next  years, will become the most common once. The new technologies probably will produce a considerably revolution in some essencial parts of the house. For example, we will have got computerizated ovens, microwaves and freezers, or we will probably have got central heating controled through  Internet from our office. Despite all of this facilities, there are some home activities that will remain the same, fortunately. Who don't like to prepare a cup of tee with traditional kettles, waiting for the boiling watter? And to read the newspaper at breakfast instead of watching TV? Some pleasures must be untouchable! We are human beings at least, not ""new technological"" machines! ",32.00
947," Dear Mrs Ryan, I received your letter last week and I would like to thank you very much. I was really surprised and happy to hear that I won the first prize On your letter you ask me some questions about my wishes: First of all, I would prefer travelling during the month of July, because I have already booked a holiday with my cousins in August. Secondly, I would prefer sleeping in a tent because I am  very active person who loves the outdoor life. Thirdly, I am keen on sailing and I have been lucky enough to practice this sport, moreover, I passed my licence last year in Port Camargue in France so it means that I can teach this sport. I also choose the Golf I have never played this sport but I am sure I will enjoy it. Would you be kind enough to tell  if I need  special clothes or equipment? Furthermore could you give me an idea about the pocket money I need? Please do not hesitate to contact me if you need more information about me. Looking forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely, Brigitte Bourgeois  [SEP]  From: Brigitte Bourgeois To: Mrs Darley - teacher Subject: short video about daily life at our school. The purpose of this report is to identify which lessons or other activities should be filmed. In order, to prepare this report I visited in many occasions the classrooms and talked to the students and teachers. It seems to me that it will be a nice idea to show our library because according to the librarians, the library has a welcoming atmosphere and is also well-used, moreover the range of books and newspapers is very large and useful. The students mentionned that it would be very interessting to show the English course because some foreign students will probably join our college next year and it is the best way for them to discover  our English course. To sum up, I would suggest to film our library because it is a pleasant place that students really like and the English course which will help foreign students for their future choice. ",36.0
946," Tuesday, 13nd June 2000 Dear Ms Ryan, I've just received the letter telling me that I've won first prize in your competition. I guess you can imagine how happy and excited I am at this time. Here are the few information about my stay at Camp California, that you asked my to complete: For the date of the travel, I wonder if it would be possible  in July because I'm going to pass a very important exam at the end of June. Two weeks in the USA would be a great occasion for me to relax after that. You asked my to chose my accommodation between  tents and cabins. I prefer sleeping in a log cabin (I made a very bad experience with tents while I was camping with friends last year) The activities listed in your letter seemded to be all interesting. I choosed to do baskelball (I play in a club, I have a good level) and  photography (there must be beautiful pictures to take in California). Talking about California, I suppose that the weather is hot there in Summer. Could you please tell me if I have to take  special clothes with me. If it's not two much to ask, could you also tell me how much money I should take with me for food or evening activities at the camp Looking for you to receive those information, Dominique  [SEP]  Last week I had planned to change my old basketball shoes. So I took the train to Lausanne (I live in Lavaux and it's impossible to find a corect pair of sneakers in this whole damned city!) to buy a new pair to play outdoor  this summer. After having visited  shops during 10 hours and tried at least 2,000 shoes, I finally found what I was looking for. The shoes of my dreams (well designed and not too expensive) So I went back to the station, very proud of me with my sneakers in a white plastic bag and a great smile on my face. I stayed that happy during the travel, thinking of how cool I would look on the playground with my brand new shoes on. As I jumped off the train, I met a friend of mine. I immediately wanted to show him what I had bought to make him jealous. I took the white plastic bag and... Oh my god! There was no more plastic bag, I had forgotten it in the train! How stupid I am! It seems like I will have to play with old shoes for one more summer... ",25.0
778," Dear Helen Ryan. I can only travel on July because these is the mounth when I have holidays. I've already talked to my manager, and she said that that's the only mounth I can have my holidays. I would prefer to stay in  log cabin because it must be cold to stay in a tent. I have some problems with my kidneys, so I can't stay in on of the tents, and it also must be very comfortable to stay  a log cabin. I'm really good at Golf and Tennis, so I would like to choose these two activities. I've been doing these activities for a very long time. I've been playing Golf for five years, and I'm a handidate cup of sixteen, but the problem is that I haven't been playing Golf for a long time because I work every day. I've been playing tannis since I was seven, and I've been studying how to play tannis for a very long time, nine years. I would like to know what kind of cloths do I need to take with me, and can you write  me back  what kind of weather it's going to be there, for the time I will be staying there. Also I would like to know how much money should I take with me, because I'm not sure how much I'll need to spend there. See you Mrs Helen Ryan, and please write me back, Ivan. S.

I asked on of the camera man when they're going to show these show on tv, and he told me they're going to show it on  10 of June, so turn on your tv on these date chanel three, and  must seem me there playing with these guitar AH it was lovely. These singers are going to come next year so I want to invite you to my house for one or two weeks to see these pop concert, beleave me you'll love it and you might use the drums, I told them that you're really good at drums so they want to try you too.

For the accommodation, I would prefer to stay in a log cabin because I think it is probably more comfortable. I think we are going to be tired so I prefer to sleep comfortably. You also asked me about two activities. I choose singing because I love singing and I am in a choir for 7 years now. I also choose climbing. Unfortunately I am not so good in it. But I would take the opportunity to improve myself. In addition, I have some questions. I would like to know which sort of clothes we have to take with us and also how much money is necessary. I look forward to hearing from you in the near future. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable Our life of today is getting even more about consommation. You always find more shops and they are open even more late. You can't live without shopping but shopping is not always enjoyable. Firstly, if you try to do your shopping during the rush hour, it could be very difficult. Everybody is stressed, you have to make the queue. It is not comfortable at all. In addition, everything is now so expensive that you have to compare the prices. You have to find which shop offers you good quality products for a good price. But sometimes some goods are expensive but of a very bad quality. And it is not an easy task if you have to complain about the quality. Most of the time the shop assistant doesn't believe you. In conclusion, I can say that shopping is not the most enjoyable task you could find. Of course you also have some good aspects but most of the time it is very unpleasant. You could try to do your shopping via  Internet. Perhaps you will find  less inconvenience. ",35.0
899," Dear Mrs Helen Ryan, I have received a letter from you saing that I have won the first prize in your competition and you need some information from me. I would like to travel on July because my hollydays are only on it and the wheather in California is better . I am that kind of person who enjoy to have a wild and simple life, so I prefer to be accommodated in tents. About the activities, the first one I would like to do is play basketball which I have a lot of experience . The second one is sailing, but I am not so good in this sport. I would like to know some more information about the Camp, before I left, which clothes are more appropriate and how much money should I take with me. Yours sincerely Augusto Roy  [SEP]  Dear Kim, How is everything? Is your dog better? Well here I'm very fine. I bought a new T.V., it's very big and I love it! In your last letter  said that you want to know about my experience at the pop concert. I enjoy it very much, it was great! There I helped with the special effects and the sound. They liked me so much and invited me to be the responsable with  lights and sound. I told then that I will think about it but I belive I will accept the job. The most increible part was the laser show. They were drowing a lot of things in the sky during the concert. Next time I'll take you and your friend Monica. I'm shure that you are going to love it. Please write back Love and Peace Augusto. ",21.0
417," Dear Mr Smith, Last week I and my family had a holiday in London. At the end of a holiday we decided to go to the theatre. I insisted on going to your theatre, to the Circle Theatre, because I have heard that it is one of the best theatres in London. That days you presented ,,The over the Rainbow"". how you have written at the advertisement: it is the London's newest and best musical show. But I and my family had a very disappointing evening. Because, at first, at the advertisement was written that in this music show would play Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, but it wasn't so. Danny Brook didn't play at the performance, there was another unknown actor. And he played awful, I couldn't hear him. Then at the adverstisement stood that  performance begin at 19.30. I and my family came to that time and had to wait till 20:15, because the show started only at that time. I was very nervious. What is more you wrote that discounts  available, but it was also  lie. After the show I was very disappointed, because I spent a lot of money for nothing and my husband decided to make me a pleasure. He suggested to have a supper in your theatre restaurant. But when we came to it, we saw that the restaurant was closed, because it was  reconstructed. But why do you mention about the restaurant at the advertisement, if it is closed? So this evening was terriable. It broke all my impression about London. And now I requere my money back. Because of nothing what was mentioned at the advertisement I didn't get.  [SEP]  There are a lot of new modern technologies around the world, which appear not long ago. Among them a mobile telephone, computers, telefaxes, different mashiens for  kitchen, mashiens which helps housekeeper to do any work about the house. All of them play a very great role in people's daily life. The first change is that they very simplify the life of people. For example, now women don't spend a lot of time at the kitchen, preparing the meal or washing up dishes. They can only push on their dish mashiens and go to do something what they think more pleasant. So with the appearance of new morden technology people have got much more free time. The computer also plays a very important role in  daily life of people. Some years ago people especially students had to run to lubraries in order to find a book about something. But now they can use  Internet, where you can find any information you need. Very often I use  Internet, and I must say it is very convienient. The another  modern technology that I use is a mobile telephone. If I need to say something important to my parents or my friends, of if something terriable has happened with me, I may not run somewhere to find a telephone box. I just use my mobile phone. Finally, I can say that modern technologies very help people at their works. With them people do their work more quikly and successfully. ",26.0
1155," Dear Mrs Maria Smith Thank you for your letter. It's a shame that I won't see Richard because of his illness, but I'm willing to help you as much as I can. Then I will give you some information which you asked for in your letter. Firstly, about your accomodation, our college which I belong to offers visitor free accomodations with full of facilities. (for example bath, car park, free internet access, etc.) They also are located in our campus so you can get to the conference by walk. Secondly, as you know we'll have a party after the conference, which will be taken place at our student council hall with some meals. This party is unlikely to be that formal, but I recommend you not to wear jeans and trainners. At last, if you have  free time for  couple of ours, you'd better visit Kamakura City, which is 30 minutes from our campus by train. That is  very traditional Japanese city where so many temple and heritages are there. I'm sure you'll enjoy it and maybe get familier with our culture. By the way, if you have any other questions, please send me a letter again.  [SEP]  Oh Baby, I can't live without you! These days, we've been sorrounded with so any different kinds of products which our ancestors invented. In our daily life, however, we seldom notice how much convinient  life we've got , what is more, how much inconvinient our grandparents had got. How nasty we are! Let us try to appreciate thier importance again. As for me, the invention which is most important to me is a personal computer. I have been a full time student in the university at home, and their classes all requires us to have personal computer and use them at any times. When you take the class on computer programming, you will definetly need one and it holds true for the class on politics, because you have to study statistic on your computer for doing social research and some analysys. My professor said 'go and get familier with your computer, otherwise you'll fail'. I find it amazingly easy to forget the importance of inventions which we useually use without any questione. That's the nature of human being. But, I think it's not only our fault but the evidence of how much they integrate  in our life. ",22.00
654," Dear Mrs Ryan I'm writing concerning your letter about my win in your competition for two weeks at Camp California. I'm very happy to be the winner from your competition. Because I'm working in an accountant office, I'm very busy. The only month I could go to holidays is July, when we haven't got a lot to do. Moreover, because of the accommodation, I would like to be in a tent, because I want to spend my holidays different than usually. And in my opinion, when you live in a tent, you have more from the nature and the adventure. I like a lot from your list for the sport possibilities, however I will choose swimming. I used to be a member in a swimming club for about 10 years. Additionally I'm keen on taking pictures. But until now I only took pictures on holidays and  some family celabrations. Lastly, I would like to ask if I have to take a lot of money with me, for example for the food. And also if the weather will be good at this time . I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable. I would like to begin this composition by saying that, not for everyone is shopping the same. For some people it's great fun, but for some other it's a ""must"". In my opinion, shopping is like relaxing. I like to go very often, to look around and to buy some new clothes. As long as I am not searching for something specific. When I must buy something, I usually can't find it and then the shopping become a nightmare. On the other hand, when you go with someone else shopping, and you both want to see and buy different things, it can also be boring and uninteresting. Then it is perhaps better, when you make an appointment in one hour and everybody enjoys the shopping alone. To sum up, I would like to say that for to have an exciting shopping , you have sometimes to plan it or just be in the right mood. ",32.0
309," Dear Manager: I reciently was in London,  in my sister's home, and I went to se ""Over the Rainbow"". I had a lots of problems and I would like to tell you about them. Early that day I went to buy the tickets and I decided to buy the expensive ones, like the promotion paper said they made discounts to people that worked at the British Institute. I mentioned it, but they told me that  promotion had ended a long time ago. Why do you put  on the paper then? In the evening I got a flat tire, and because of this I got late to the show, when I got to my place, it was used (it cost a lot) and they took me to the cheapest seats, where I couldn't see a thing. After waiting a while in this uncomfortable place the show started, I waited 45 minutes and then the actors appeared, but I find myself that the main one wasn't Danny Brook, it was an impostor. And finally when the show ended I decided to go  eat something, but the restaurant was closed because the chef was sick. Sorry, but all these stuff are not proffesional, and I am going to make a demand exactly because you don't have that, if you don't give me my money back. I hope you understand me  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Yesterday I decided to go to the ""blue disco"" because the guy I liked was going to be there. But there was a little problem and it was that my parent's didn't let me go alone to disco's, so I had to go illegaly, and I decided I would do it. That night I waited until my parents were asleep and I went out  my window. I had told Pat to pick me up, she was the only one that new my plan. I made her promise she wouldn't tell anyone my secret. So when we arrived to the disco there was my guy waiting for me. To sumarize the night I am going steady with him, and he took me home. The next morning Pat came to my house, I was sleeping so she talked to my mom and she suddenly asked her: At what time did Catana arrive  last night?... All the truth was then told, and now I am grownded for life. She defintevely doesn't know how to keep secrets. ",30.0
802," Dear Ms. Helen. Ryan, Thank you for your confirming about the first prize in your competition. I was pleased as I got it. I'll confirm about my hopes. I hope I'll be able to travel on July. Due to the fact that my children have summer holiday from July. I prefer to stay in log cabins , therefore I'm going to travel with 2 children and my dog. I wonder if I can take them as well. Then I'd like to join the activities, swimming and Singing. I love swimming and also I've got a scubar diving licence. I used to enjoy floting on the water whenever I was on holiday. Singing is the most favarite hobby for us. We often go out to sing in  Karaoke bar. My son experienced winning the first prize in a Karaoke competition. I'd like to know that how much monery,  how many clothes we need. It would be grateful if you sent me more details I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely Hana Soma  [SEP]  First of all we can't go shopping without money. Nowadays, most product's prices has gone up with our own country's economy development. Despite the poor material of product, we have to pay much money, even though we  completely satisfied  shopping at that time, we sometimes regret buying after the shopping. It sounds like foolish. However it often happen. Secondary the customer's service often makes us angry. Of couse, the shopkeepers are human being as well. But for their considerations, they're working in their rutines. So their attitude sometimes seems to be bossy and pushy. I sometimes loose my desire to buy a thing because of their badly behaviers. Moreover, shopping is just a part of life style. It's necessary to buy something to alive. We have to buy for some thing. For example, for our jobs supecial ceremonys and so on. Even when the risk comes up with shopping. To sum up, shopping is not always enjoyable for us ",24.0
438," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to you to complain about the musical show I went to see last Wednesday. I was told I would have the most perfect evening in London, but it was not. When I bought my ticket I expected to be able to take advantage of those discounts you announced in the newspaper advertisement but when I had to pay the most expensive price. I went to see the performance at 19:30 but it did not start until 20:15! I was really angry but I wanted to see Danny Brook. My surprise was when, instead of Mr. Brook, a different actor appeared on stage. At the end of the show I decided to go to the theatre restaurant but when I arrived I realized it was closed because the musical show had finished too late! All I am asking for is a full refund of the money I spent in the musical. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Now Marion was really angry with her. Some days ago Pat met her friend Paul, the editor of the school's newspaper. Paul asked her some questions about her childhood and her toys because he was going to write an article about children. While Pat was talking she remembered playing with her dolls and spending a good time with them. Then Paul asked her if she knew something about Marion's childhood. Pat told him some unimportant things such as she learnt to swim at the age of five or that she loved ants. But, suddenly, she started to talk about Marion's toys. She told Paul she had a special toy called Max and that she slept with him. A terrible mistake! In the following edition the headline was: ""Why  a teenager sleeps with a toy called Max?"" Everybody laughted at her. Marion felt really embarrassed. Two weeks later everybody forbade about Marion's secret and she took into account her relationship with Pat. They became friends again. But Marion would never tell Pat a secret again!! ",37.0
890," Dear Helen Ryan, I am writing to ask for some queries about your letter which I have received. Firstly, I would like to travel  Camp California on Monday, 6th July, because my school's holiday will begin at the end of June. Otherwise I will not be able to join that camp. Secondly, could you make an arrangement for me to stay in a log cabin, because it seems that living in log cabins is more exciting than in tents. Also I would prefer to go swimming and surfing, because I used to be an assistant in a Korean national pool so that I am good at swimming. However, I have never tried to go surfing. That is why I would like to do that. Finally, could you tell me if I have to bring some clothes, towels and extra money? I would be appreciated it if you supply some towers, if possible. Thanks for your attention. I really look forward to receiving your reply soon. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Kim, It seems ages since I wrote to you. How have you been? How's your new flat? When I received your letter with photographs of that flat, it really looked nice. Anyway, I'll tell you about my wonderful experience which I enjoyed at a pop concert. It took place in a Korea national center which was the biggest building in Korea. There were a lot of people, I guess over 50,000, who wanted to see famous singers and listen to their songs. I helped to guide foreginers who would like to take participated in that. You know, I have studied English for two years in England. That's why I could attend to that concert as a volunteer, because they needed people who could speak English very well. What I really enjoyed was meeting famous World singers such as Madona, Bon Jovi, Ena and so on. I got Madona's signature! Can you believe it? I'll show you that and some pictures. I really hope to see you soon. Best wishes, ",28.0
1032," Basle, 12th Decembre 2000 (Your English class N3c) Dear Mr Robertson, We have received the programme. We'd like to thank you for organising  good programme, especially the shopping tour on Tuesday. Our class is especially interested in  latest fashion and trends. London is a good place for discovering it. We've seen an advertisement for 'the London Fashion and Leisure Show' and all of us are very interested in it. It's an exhibition of fashions, sport wears, make up and hairstyles. We think it is a great opportunity because there are some people in our class who like to study fashions after leaving this school. And everyone of us is interested in fashions and clothes! This exhibition is situated in  Central Exhibition Hall, London. We've noticed that the exhibition will be on Tuesday,  14th of March. Could we change our programme? We'd like to do our shopping tour on  next following day (Wednesday afternoon) instead of Tuesday afternoon. What do you think about our suggestion? Please write back as soon as possible. We hope to hearing from you soon. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Basle, 12th Decembre 2000 Dar Oxana, Thanks for your letter. It's nice to hear from you again. In your letter, you asked me wheter the book I've read would be a suitable present for your cousin's fifteenth birthday. It's my pleasure to write my suggestion for you now! You know I love reading books, it's my passion. I've read all the books of  English author Ernest Hemingway. They are great I tell you! But I think your cousin is too young for it. Why? Because he especially concentrates on  history, social life and politic situation in the time the story is played. That might be quiet complicated to understand, especially for young people. For me, his books are great. But anyway, do you know the book with the title 'The Best Detective Stories of Agatha Christie'? It's written by Agatha Christie. She's an American and her books concentrate on crime and detective stories. Her books aren't difficult to understand. She especially write books for young people. And I think this book is a very good one for your cousin. You wrote that your cousin is quite intered in magic, detectives and sport, didn't you? I think this is the best choice for him! I've send you a copy of the summary from the book and an interesting article about the author and the book. Please read it and write your comments. I hope to hearing from you soon! Have fun with it and say hello to your cousin! See you soon! Love, ",16.00
1232," Dear Madam, I received your letter and I'm pleased to answer your questions. M. Brown has booked rooms in the Palace Hotel. This is a first class hotel. The easiest way  from the hotel to the conference is with the bus. There is a bus stop in front of your hotel. Take the bus in  direction   center  town. After four stops get off the bus. The name of this bus stop is 'Kongresshaus'. If you leave the bus, the conference is in the house opposite the road. You can't miss it. Afterwards we will eat together in a restaurant and we will go in a disco. For the disco you musn't wear blue jeans. Finally at your last day I propose you to do a sightseeing tour in our town. It takes you two hours. Afterwards you will have any time to buy some souvenirs from Switzerland. If you have any more questions, write me back. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  I will write about the invention of the computer. With the computer our work is easier and more interesting. Before the time with computers, people had to write every time a whole letter . When they  would correct a word, they had to write the whole letter again. With the computer we can write a letter, correct a word or change the name without writting the whole letter again. We save the letter and in three week we could send it to another person. I work at a bank and I work all day with computers. If we hand't ay one, we had to write all the transactions on papers. If I order money for our bank with the computer I can be sure that I will arrive the day after. But if I had to write a letter and to send it by post, the money will arrive two or three days after. I have never work without a computer, but if we hadn't any we would it find normally. ",29.00
208," Dear Sir/Madam, Recently I had a week's holiday in London. During my stay I went to The Circle Theatre to see ""Over the rainbow"", the ""London's newest and best musical show."" I have to admit that  was my great mistake. Never before had I  such a disappointing evening. First of all, there was an old, ugly, and unknown actor in the main part instead of  brilliant Danny Brook! To make matters worse, the show started at 20.15, although the advertisement was saying it would begin at 19.30. Moreover, there weren't any discounts, and I had to pay much more for my ticket than I had expected. And on the top of everything your theatre restaurant was closed because of the waiters' strike, so I had to look for another place to have a snack. You can imagine how upset I am at having suffered such discomfort and disappointment. It wasn't a ""perfect evening out"" at all! That is why I expect at least half the ticket price back. I hope you will give this matter your immediate consideration. Otherwise I'll have to apply to  court for aid. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Fashion of the Future. What will clothes be like 100 years from now? This question is not simple to answer. On the one hand, science and technology have been developing rapidly, and God knows what new materials will be invented in  future. We probably will be wearing dresses made of synthetic artificial cloth in 2100. Of course, those new material won't be so harmful for our health as today's nylon and other things like that. On the other hand, people tend to wear natural clothes today, made of cotton, wool . This tendency may result in turning down synthetics at all. And it is even more difficul to predict how the clothes of the future will look like. People's  fantasy is enormous. Anyway, we'll give up wearing fur coats as it is cruel and uncivilised. ",30.0
1060," Dear Mr Robertson, I am writing to confirm that we have received your programme for our class for the three days, during our stay in London, and would like to thank you. Firstly, the whole class is very pleased with the programme, especially with the visit to the National Art Gallery. As we have been told, there are a lot of interesting paintings and ancient sculptures  in which we all are keen to see it. A couple of days ago, my classmates made the suggestion, that they would also like to see the London Fashion And Leisure Show in London,  Central Exhibition Hall, which was advertised in a school magazine and there is free entry for students. The show includes the latest fashion wear, sports wear for spare time, make up and hairstyles. At the same time it would be a great opportunity for most of us because we are going to study ""Art and Design"" next year. We agreed in the class  to visit this show on Tuesday 14 March in the afternoon after lunch instead of  shopping. Do you think it is possible? We would be grateful, if you could consider our suggestion and hope to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  To be famous or not to be famous? Well, first of all, I think it's quite difficult to be a musician, film star or a politician without being followed by journalists all the time. In my opinion, most of these people are aware of the consequences  like not to have a ""private life"" anymore. As soon as they are famous, they are surrounded by their fans and reporters in every place. I can imagine, how annoying it can be sometimes. Just think that you'd like to go shopping, clubbing or to a restaurant with friends. There's really no way to be together just only with your friends or relatives without being disturbed by these paparazzis. On the one hand I can understand how important it is for the journalists to take pictures for the newspaper or magazines they work for. It is the way how they earn money, of course. But on the other hand I have to mention that they are going too far sometimes to take a picture. For example Lady Diana. Do you think she would have been still alive if she and her boyfriend hadn't been followed by these nosy paparazzis? Well, this will be an open question to anyone. ",35.00
493," Dear Sir: I'm writing to you to complain about last evening musical show. I was very happy to see your musical show but I have to say that it has been a very disappointing evening. At first my favourite actor Danny Brook didn't perform without any explictions , and the show should started at 19:30 instead of 20:15!! I was sure that discouts were available because I have read it , but at the tickets office they didn't accept them. What a terrible evening! So I payed  the ticket. After the show I was hungry so I went to the restaurant but it was closed! It wasn't my perfect evening out so I'd like to have my money back!

Jim's mum didn't want him to take her suitcase, but he did it. So a morning he reached Victoria Station with the suitcase and take the train for the countryside where he had to work. But when he walked out  the station he realised that he have lost the suitcase on the train. Then he waited for the next train to London and he caught it. He was worried about his mother's reaction, but when he arrived he went to the Station Manager's office and he found it on the table. He was so happy! All this story was a secret but Pat realived  to his mother. She was so angry and confused because Jim haven't told her the truth. ",26.0

If it is possible I would like to travel in July because school is finishing on the 28th June and I have already excepted a job in August. I think it would be fun to stay in a tent those two weeks, I have never done that before, by my friends told me that I would enjoy it. As you offer many activities it was hard to choose which ones I want to do, but I dicided to take swimming and photography, because I am very good at swimming and because currently I am attending a photography course in Vienna. I am not very experienced but I think that I will find a lot of beautiful motives in the USA. I would be very kind if you could inform me about how much money I have to take with me and which clothes I will need. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Dear Kim, Thank you for the card you wrote to me, I hope you enjoyed your holidays. I spent some great days in Vienna where I had the chance to help at the concert of ""pearl jam"". The first thing I didwas to controll the tickets of the fans who visited  the concert together with a friend of mine. There always was a lot of security stuff around us to make sure every thing is ok, because there really were thousends of persons. Then we had time to listen to the music. The other thing I had to do was to make some sandwiches and drinks just before they returned behind the stage to rest a little bit before they continued playing. It was amazing to be in the same room they were . Edi Vedder even talked to me about their programms! I think that I will never see them again personally, but I will never forget those two days - being so close to them, unbelievable! Hope to see you soon ! Yours ",32.0
1089," Dear Mr Robertson I am writing to request your permission for us to visit the London Fashion and Leisure Show on 14th March. First of all, I would like to say thank to you for this good programme, especially  the decision of going to visit in London. All of us is appreciated that we could have this opportunity. Because most students have never been to London before, also we could visit some famous places which we wanted to go . However, we would be grateful if you would arrange a time to visit the show additionally. This show takes place at  Central Exhibition Hall on Tuesday from 10:00 to 19:00. In this show, not only can we see  latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles, but we also can enter for free. Moreover some students think that they would like to do fashion studies in future. If you would accept and wouldn't mind this idea, we would like to visit it instead of shopping in the afternoon on Tuesday. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Nowadays, quite a few famous people suffer  their private life from disturbers such as journalists or reporters. I would like to think how  media effect to famous people. Few years ago, we had a terrible news of  death of Lady Diana. She was always been aftering by  media. She had no private life even though she wanted to be alone. Finally, after chasing for  long time, she was dead because of  car accident. It must be a good example of  media disaster. I understand she had a good reason to be chased by it. However she definetely deserve to have a private life as one of citizen. Human right must be existed for all people. On the other hand, there are  few famous people  desire to be watched by  media. If  media stopped focusing  the people, they would think as if they are put in a bin like rubbish. Moreover, many people love to watch a gossip programme on TV or  in a magazine. It is one  of fun in our life. On balance, ",24.00
784," Dear Ms. Ryan I recived your letter recently, and I am really happy learning that I won the first prize. So, I am writing to you to answer your questions. First of all, I have to tell you that my only chance is go there in July, it does not matter the dates, but it is important for me to be back before the 1st of August, because that day I will start a summer job. About he acommodation during those two weeks, I would rather staying in a log cabin, as it is really difficult for me to be in a little and close room. Your next question is about the activities that I could do at the camp, after browse through the list, I would like to take part in climbing and photography activities, as these are my favourite hobbies. I had a induction climbing course two years ago, and I still going to climbing regulary, I can do a V+ level climb. On the other hand I had a photography course five years ago, and I took part in several competitions. Finally, could you tell me how far is the nearest town or village? Can we get there by public transport? Looking forward for your answer. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Shopping, what an exciting thing! Going out to spend a day shopping is something very popular, the shopping centers are always busy,  people going up and down carrying bags and looking at window shops,  seems everbody is happy. Really? Sometimes things can be wrong and the situations changes and becomes a nightmare. Firstly  is the parking problem, if you go to shopping late at weekends for instance, it's really difficult to find a place to park your car, and when you get the place,  pay for it! Then the search for a nice cloth starts, and when eventually you get it, it isn't your size, but also the colour that you like is not available. Finally you've found out something really wonderful, time to pay! With the hurries you've forgotten to bring any cash, but you can use the plastic money, the shop assistant pass the credit card through the machine, after  few seconds  again, and  another time more, suddenly his face changes and  says you that the card is fault! No choice, you have to leave your nice clothes and go away feeling bad and sad. To sum up, shopping is not always enjoyable, but don't worry, the shooping center  still there waiting for you! ",33.0
978," Dear Misses RYAN I am writing to inquire whether there is possible to have more details about travel and to give my preferences about travel. Indeed I would rather to travel only on July since I'm going to work in august in order to earn money to pay  my studies next year. Moreover I would prefer being accommodate in  log cabins because I can't put up with mosquitos and other insects which risk coming into tents. Besides I've chosen two activities from the list: Tennis as I practice this sport regularly and I'm very good in this activity and Golf because I ignore all about this sport and I wish I will discover it thanks to you. On the other hand, I would obtain some details about the kind of clothes that I should carry with me and how much money to take You don't hesitate to contact me in order to have further information. I hope quickly hearing from you Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear readers As you have already know, your English class is going to make a short video about daily life at your school, that's why I'm writing a report suggesting which, lessons and other activities, should be filmed. First of all, he seems obvious that we should, at least once, film a lesson with our English teacher who have had the idea to make this short video. Besides I would suggest filming a lunch to the restaurant at twelve o'clock in order that people are aware of the high level of noises inside the restaurant because of  babbles. At the end, to my opinion, It would be interesting to film a course of sport in order that our parents realise that we improve our body's abilities, and not only our brain's abilities at school.

1176," Dear Mrs Smith, I am writing with reference on your letter concerning an organization of an international student conference in Wimbledon Art College. Below I am clarifying some information you asked about. First of all, I would like to give you more information about  name and location of the hotel. The group has been booked into  ""Maria Luisa"" hotel which is situated on the center of Wimbledon called Wimbledon Village. This hotel is the next building after  Art College, so it will be easy for your group to find the place. Secondly turning to the end-of-conference party, it is planed to be in Wimbledon Common -  nice piece of England nature. So, it may be a good idea to take some very comfortable and informal clothes. Thirdly, talking about your free afternoon before leaving the area, I would suggest you to visit  Wimbledon Museum of Tennis. Where is quite  good exposition their, giving interesting information about the history of Wimbledon Tennis Tournaments. I look forward to meeting your group in our conference. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Report. Introduction: The purpose of this report is to give a brief discription of the Academy of Art in St.-Petersburg. From my point of view this building is the best option to visit. Location: This building is situated on the magnificent embankment of  Niva River with an exellent view on the Hermitage Museum. History: The building was built by  very famious Russian architect and is a marvellouse example of Russian classic architerture of  XVIIIth century. Facilities: In the Academy of Art you can find the oldiest art libarary with a wide range of books,  the Museum of Russian Art with a huge collection of painting, sculpture and architectural projects from  early eighteenth to late twentieth centuries. It is also a good chance to be introduced with  Russian system of art education. Conclusion: The building of  Academy of Art in St.-Petersburg is worth visiting and interesting as  historical as educational aspects. ",27.00
587," Dear Helen Thank you for my prize! I  never been in the USA and I should be glad to spend two weeks at Camp California. I can only have some holidays in July from the 3rd to the 17th with my husband at the same time, that is why I would like to travel during those two weeks. For the accommodation I would prefer to have  tents because I used to travel in Campsites and I love it during summer, just to change the customs!! Concerning those activities I have choosen two of them. I enjoy swimming and anytime I have  opportunities to swim I go. My second activity is painting because I love art and art history and I think that  is better to join one sport and one ""soft leisure"" and I do not really want to involve myself in a new activity that I don't know for my holidays. Please could you tell me about the weather if I need special clothes and about the money for the change if you don't mind. See you soon! Yours Sincerely  [SEP]  ""Shopping is not always enjoyable"" ""Shopping today!""  You decide to go in town or during holidays to move in a ""shopping destination"", that is mean that you need something special for you or someone else. You have the money and the time as you want. That's why it should be a great day! Save some money to go for shopping in Paris or Roma and see how is the French or Italian fashion  on yourself! and after that you can make a stop in the Duty-free  and buy some chipper souvenirs. Singapoor and many places in Asia are famous for the shopping, and it is really nice to go there with  money to buy that you always wanted to. But even if shopping can means dream it can be boring sometimes. If you have no money and a friend ask you to come for shopping, it should be boring! and you  become jealous against him and want him to do that quickly! or you  are going to get nervous! And you can find  too much people in  shops, it is too hot or you can not have your right size or the right colour or flavour -- - then you get angry! or you decide to not spend  money in shopping today, but in front of the shop. What is going on?? So, you'd better to stay  home today... ",21.0
345," Dear Manager of the Circle Theatre I recently had a week's holiday in London. During my stay, I went to the Circle Theatre to see your musical show called 'Over the rainbow'. It was actually very disappointing and I have to say that I want my money back as you said 'your pefect evening' out in your advertisement and I rally do think it was not the perfect evening out. Here are the problems of your show. In your advertisement, it says that Danny Brook will act but he did not. It was a different actor and I was very disappointed. It says that the show starts at 14:30 and 19:30 but the show started at 20:15 which was 45 minutes late. The price of  ticket was another problem. Your advertisement says 'discounts available' but it was not available. I did not get  discount. I really liked your idea of visiting your theatre restaurant, but because of the late start of the show, the restaurant was closed by the end of the show. I really do think you need to organise your show a bit more carefully so you do not make these mistakes in future and it will be kind of you if you give my money back. Yours faithfully Ring T Lun  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed your daily life? I believe that modern technology has changed a lot of people's daily life. My daily life also got affected by modern technology a lot. The modern technology which changed my daily life most is a personal computer. I can do a lot of things using the computer. I can play games, listen to music, and I can do my course works in the computer. The main advantage of modern technology is getting more informations in  shorter time. I can go on  internet in my house using computers or from outside using mobile phones. I don't have to go to  library and read hundred's of books to find informations anymore. I have TV's and radios so I can watch or listen to various newses and I don't have to go to football pitches to see how the players are playing. There are, of course some disadvantages. Nowadays, it is too easy to get lazy because of modern technology. I do not have to walk or run a lot to go somewhere. There are plenty of trains and buses. I have to spend my time doing some exercises or I will get really lazy and unfit. I sometimes think that it might not be a good idea to use modern technology a lot. I think modern techonology has changed my daily life a lot and I hope it will develop even more to change my life even more. ",29.0
1002," Dr Mrs Ryan, With replay on your letter, I would like to say that I was really pleased with the first prize. It was the real surprise for me. I would like to travel just in July, because I am going to study at my university untill the end of June. I hope it will not be any problem for you. I am glad that all accommodation and travel costs have been paid. I would prefer to live in the tent cabin, I think it is more comfortable. I see people who run the camp are very good in organize a social life of their guests. I have a lot of posibilities for spending my spare time. The climbing and the painting are preferred by me the most. Generally I paint some landscapes by using the watercolours, but sometimes I try to paint like during the impresionist  by using blobs, oil paint and canvases. At the end I would like to ask what kind of clothes I have to take with me and how much money I will need for the normal life at the camp. I am looking  to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Report on making a interesting video film The aim of this report is to suggest which lessons and other activities should be place at  video film about daily life at our school. In order to preper it I visited some clasrooms during the lessons and I interviewed a number of students from our school. Some of the teachers are very good just profesionalists. Their lessons are valuable, rich in knowledge and funy. For example, the teacher of history and polish language is able to interest students about the subject in differents ways. According to students' oppinions the most popular activities are the basketball, tennis, swimming and as well the photography group and the painting team. It is surprising that 45 per cent of the students questioned frequent one of this sport's group and 30 per cent of people go to the photography group. On the whole our school have a lot of different possibilities for the students what we can show on our film. It can maks the video more interesting. I recommend to show our teacher of history. It can show that during every day we have a big fun and we recived a good, important knowledge. If we take under an attention this things our film is going to be very interesting ",22.0
1087," Dear Mr. Robertson, I would like to say ""thank you"" for this London trip plan. We are really excited about it. Especially the boat trip on  river  is a good idea because we all want to see Greenwich. We also enjoy the idea of going to the National Art Gallery and sightseeing by bus. It seems it's going to be a great fun. I do not know if it is possible to make any change in this plan but we saw an ad in ""Time Out"" magazine last week about a fashion show which we would like to see. The show's date is very convinient - March 14 -, and it is on   Central Exhibition Hall so I do not think it would be a problem to get there. As you know, we all come from different countries and we are keen on learning some other things about English culture besides the language itself. Joining this fashion and leisure show, we will get the chance to see a lot of enjoyable and different things, such as new hair styles and make up ways, or what is  fashion in London recently. Briefly, we would be happy if we could see this show instead of the Science Museum. We can find another chance to go to the Science Museum in any other day, but this show is just for this Tuesday. Also, it's free for students. I hope, it wouldn't cause a trouble to change the programme. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Although human is a social creature, all people need an area  to be able to stay away from other people. This is essential to renew the energy which is necessary for daily life. Also we all like to have some special things and people in our lives to help us to feel different from others. It can be a lover, a hobby or a habit. Thinking about famous people, we generally tend to ignore this need. I believe this feeling sources from a strange though; when somebody gets famous, whatever the job is they do, we think we have some kind of right over them. Consequently we demand to know every single detail about them and their lives. Press takes this demand as an order, and ""but  public wants to know"" becomes a nightmare for famous people. In fact, what is a need for ordinary people is a more important need for famous people. Because they have to spend too much time in front of other people, they are even more sensitive about their privacy. I am quiet sure,  even the ones, who have chosen their occupies just to be famous, don't like to be pictured when they believe they are alone. The situation much be much worse for the ones who have become famous without desiring this. Obviously, there is no point in saying ""famous people have a right to their own live."" Although this statement is absuletely true, it seems there is no way to stop public attention, so they will  keep living with journalists. ",34.00
211," Dear Sir or Madam: I am writing this letter I  order to complain  my unpleasant experience in your theatre. Two days ago, I went to see the musical show ""over the rainbow"" at your theatre. The advertised beginning time is 19:30. But due to some unknown reasons, the play didn't start until 20:15. The audience were anxious and bored. What made things even worse was that the leading actor Danny Brook did not appear at the stage at all. A second-class actor took the place of him. We felt totally disappointed and cheated. After the show, I was hungry and tired. As your poster suggested, I intended to rest for a while at your restaurant. But when I got there, it had closed. In addition, the conductor didn't offer me any discounts as you had advertised in the poster when I bought the ticket. I am sorry to say that I do not enjoy the evening at your theatre at all. I hope you can pay me the money back as compensation. I am waiting for your reply. Yours Faithfully   [SEP]  Modern technology has changed my daily life in two ways. First with a lot of advanced techniques being put into practical use, our living condition becomes more and more convenient and comfortable. When we look around in the house, it is easy to find things like these:  microwave oven, TV set, computer, etc. All these  equippments are the applications of modern science. When you are planning to travel, you can choose  train, car or even  plane as your  transportation. Without the development of modern technology, it may take your several years to reach the destination. Second, Modern technology makes communication much easier and more enjoyable. With the spreading use of  Internet, people living in different parts of the world can chat with each other through the web. And, we can also share important informations with other people. The development of information technology has changed the world into ""an earth village"". Modern technology plays an important role in our life. I am hoping to devote myself into the development of it. ",27.0
451," Dear Sir, I am writing to explain to you what the problems were at the musical show ""Over the rainbow"" at your theatre. On your announcement foil I read that the actor was Danny Brook, but in the show there was a different actor: this is the first disappointing thing. The second problem was that the show should have started at 19:30; but it did not; it started at 20:15! On the announcement foil I read that we could have had some discounts, but it was not true. This is a very disappointing thing! Then your theatre restaurant after the show was closed because the staff were not there; so we could not visit it. I expected you to prepare ""our perfect evening out"" for us; but you did not for unknown reasons. So, now I ask you to send my money back, because I really did not enjoy that night. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Kim, her friend, used to go camping at Sunset Village every year, and that year Kim, asked Pat to come with her. She accepted. In the evening Pat and Kim used to walk along the beach and they used to stop and turn at the Main Rock, a very big rock. But one night, with the moon light, they felt encouraged to continue their walk. Pat was a little bit afraid, but Kim convinced her to follow her saying that she knew the street. But, when they heard a scream, they stopped and, when they saw a shadow coming forward them, they started running, hearing a voice saying: ""Our secret!"" When they returned to Caan, their town, they promised to keep silence about that. But Pat, coming back hom, told her mother everything. That night Kim heard another scream and the day after she ran to Pat to tell her what she heard. But Kim, and no one else found Pat. ",29.0
381," TO THE MANAGER OF ""THE CIRCLE THEATRE"" AFTER FINISHING A STRESSFUL YEAR AT SCHOOL, I TOOK A SHORT HOLIDAY, WHOSE ""SPLENDID ENDING"" WAS A WEEK IN LONDON, WHILE I WAS THERE, I SAW A VERY ATTRACTIVE SIGN: THE ""OVER THE RAINBOW"" MUSICAL SHOW WAS BEING PLAYED AT YOUR THEATRE, MOREOVER, THE WONDERFUL DANNY BROOK WAS THE PROTAGONIST OF IT. SADLY, I DECIDED TO GO, ALONG WITH MY GIRLFRIEND, BUT THE PROBLEMS STARTED EVEN BEFORE THE SHOW, WHEN WE WANTED TO BUY THE TICKETS. WE ASKED ABOUT ""THE DISCOUNTS"" THAT WERE OFFERED IN THE ADVERTISEMENT AND THE ONLY THING THAT THE LADY WHO WAS SELLING  COULD SAY WAS: WHAT DISCOUNTS? THEN, WE MOVED INSIDE THE THEATRE AND WE HAD TO WAIT 45 MINUTES UNTIL THE SHOW BEGAN!!, WHILE WE WERE WAITING, WE THOUGHT WE COULD GO TO THE RESTAURANT AFTER THE EVENT, AND THEN, WE REALIZED IT WAS CLOSED. BY THE TIME THE SHOW STARTED, WE WERE SO ANGRY THAT THE ONLY THING I REMEMBER IS THAT DANNY BROOK WASN'T ACTING. I THINK YOU HAVE ALREADY REALIZED THAT IT WASN'T A PLEASURE FOR US TO SEE THE SHOW, SO I HOPE YOU COULD GIVE ME OUR MONEY BACK, IF YOU CAN'T, PLEASE, AT LEAST GIVE ME AN EXPLANATION.

1234," Dear Mrs Smith, I am writting to answer your letter where you asked for information about the conferents and other points in relation with . The hotel where your group has been booked is the Palace Hotel. It is a very nice hotel in the centre of the city, and that is very near of the college which the conference is into, five minutes walking. Going walking is quicker than waiting for a taxi or a bus. When you arrive to the Colleges there will be people indicating the way to the conference room. At the end of the conference we are doing a party with some cold good and some drinks. There will be music as well for dancing. The director of the College has suggested to wear smart clothes for that occasion and I give you the same advice. About the afternoon before  leaving I have some suggestions. In the area of the Hotel there are two interesting places to visit. One is the Picasso museum and the other is an important Gallery where you can enjoy seeing differents kinds of paintings. I hope my information can help you and it has been useful for you. I am looking forwards to see you at the Conference. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  There is an invention that I think that has been very important: the computer.

But computers don't have affected only  in a good way because thank you to computers the number the places of work  for the persons is minor. But, definetely they has been a very important invention.

40," Dear: Jane Clark I had been  your annual international art festival. Most of the events I went to were good, but I feel that the festival could be even better next year. So, I write some of my opionions and suggestions to you. I hope it's may help for next year's festival. The idea of  ""International Art Festival"" was great. But I feel the word of ""International"" was not really suit; because you just only got six countrie's stars and artists came. I think you should invite more than ten countries. The other problem was choosing space. Like the hall of  classical concert was too small and crowded. Next year, you should calulate or examine how many people come before you choose a hall, which I feel very good was plays and films. It can show more for next year's festival. The Dance Shows as well. And the offer of  ""weedend ticket"" was an excellent idea. Because the price was cheaper than buy it sperate and more convience. Look forward for next year's festival. Yours Sinicerely,  [SEP]  One day, a little girls called Sara. She was walking over a bridge. Suddenly, she heart a men voice called her ""Sara...Sara.. look down to the river."" Then Sara looked down the river. She was very scared. Because she saw a golden fish  was smiling at her and talking to her. After a few second, Sara felt that  golden fish was lovely. She never seen any fish  had that wonderful colour and can talk with her. Because Sara hasn't got any bother and sister, and her Mon and Dad need work everyday, so she was very lonely. Therefore, she came  river everyday and talk  everything to the golden fish. They were very close friend. After half  year,  golden fish suddenly disappear. Sara was very sad. She sat and cry on the river. Then somebody called her name ""Sara... Sara.. look at me.. I'm stand on your left hand side. Sara remembered the was golden fish. She suddenly become a human, a little boy. After a few day they got married. Both together had their wonderful life. This story happened a long time ago. ",22.00
1025," Dear Mr Robertson! Thank you very much for  good programme! We like it very much! But we would like to go to the London Fashion and Leisure Show. It is on Tuesday. We think, that you also would like to go there, when you'll know about it better. There will be showed the latest fashions. Also, we will see leisure and sports wear. We know, that you wanted to have another  and didn't know which one. If we go to the show, we will see many hairstyles. Maybe it'll help you choose. Also, you'll be glad to know, that for students it is free! So, we think, that it is very good as for you as for us. So, we can change your programme a little bit to the best one. On Monday afternoon we have the river trip to Greenwich, as you have written on your programme. On Tuesday morning we go to the show and after that shopping. And on Wednesday morning we go to the national art gallery, but after that we can go to the Science Museum, in the afternoon. Our class asks you to think about this programme. We're sure, that you like it very much!  [SEP]  It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. My best friend told me, she met one boy. She liked him very much. She was speaking about him every time. She told me, that he was hansom, kind,  well-understanding (he understood her from a half of the word); the main  was he also liked her very much! I belived everything she has told me. And said just to be careful. But in three days she hasn't been at home. She disappeared! We called the police. They advised us to wait. But we couldn't just sit and wait! We had to do something. In three days of her disappearing the phone has rung. I took the phone. Someone told me if I wanted to see my friend, I must take 5000$ and bring them up to the street. I took any papers, put them to one bag and without saying anything went to my friend to take something  like  gun. The friend gave me his toy  and I gone to the street. There I saw a man and my friend. I showed the man, that I had a gun and money. I  surprised that he belived me. Of course, it was better for us. I gave him the bag took the friends hand and we run away. After that she told me, that the man was the boy, which she met. Don't believe everyone! Better check, if you are not sure! ",23.00
1094,"  Dear Mr Robertson, I'm writing  you because I had been asked to make a little suggestion about the programme your have organised to our English class travel. First of all, thank you for the programme, we think it is very good, especially the river trip to greenwich, we believe we will enjoy  a lot going to greenwich. Moreover, in our opinion, this travel is going to be very interesting for us. On the other hand, we have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure show and we would all like to go the show. We think it is a good opportunity because london fashion is the most important over the world, and we all learn a lot about London style going to this show. We think we could change  shooping  for going to the show. The show is free, and it is only on Tuesday 14th of March. It is open from 10.00 until 19.00, and we could go there on the afternoon. Thank you for your attention. We are looking forward to your answer, Yours sincerely  [SEP]   Thinking about the media's treatment of famous people, I've realised of some things. On my point of view the media's treatment of famous people is very bad. The media's are looking forward to create great expectations about famous people. They are not trying to give information, they are only looking to get money, and to entertain the public. On the other hand, if the media's are acting in that way  is because of the society. The society  is who increases the audience of the media, if nobody gave attention to the famous people private lifes, this treatment would finish. But in my opinion, before you get famous you know which are the consequences. As in another  you may know what could happen. To sum up, there is no job perfect, and be famous involves a lof  money, but also a lot of jouralists following your private life. ",27.00
1152," Dear Mrs Maria Smith, I was delighted to receive your letter and to know that a group of students from your college have decided to take a part in our international student conference. As you need more information, I answer all your questions with plesuare. Firstly, the Palace Hotel has been booked for your group. It is one of the most comfortable hotels in our sity and situated only half a mile from  main building of our college, so it is very simple to get from there to the conference by foot. Secondly, our end-of-conference party is included dinner and dancing, I would advise you to wear something not very formal. Finally, you can spend an afternoon on the last day visiting local historical places (castles, builded in  13-th century) or art gallery, as well as  beatiful Bodnant garden. I am looking forward to the meeting with you and  mutual work during conference. Your sincerely  [SEP]  There are many different people's inventions around us. We are so used to them, that sometimes  think they existed always. Some of them are very practical, other are rather strange. I thing, that one of the most importent and affecting our life inventions is the telephone. Imagine life without  phone. You are on the road, you have  car accident. What are you going to do without  phone? On another situation, your son is ill, he needs help urgently. I am sure, the phone has saved many lifes. Besides, it is always very nice to ring your friend or mum, only for chating in any time. Thanks  the phone, it is possible even your mam is on the other end of the Earth. To be honest,  next great invention of people,  computer, can't work, if you haven't got the phone. So I am very grateful to  man, who invented it, unfornutely, I have forgotten his name. It always happens with people, doesn't ? Try to ask who invented the will or the book. ",28.00
1115," Dear Mr Robertson, We would like to thank you for the programme which you have prepared for us. We really like the variety of our trip to London. The programme contains enjoyment and education, what is very esencial for young people. However, we would like to say, that recently the advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show has been seen by one of your English class student. The show will be about  latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles. In our opinion, we should go to the show. Firstly, because we are keen on fashion. Secondaly, because we do not have to pay for the tickets. We have already orgonised our visit  new programme. The show is on tuesday and we could go to see the show in the afternoon, instead of  shopping. We think, that we may  shopping  next day, on wednesday, in our free time. We are looking foraward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  Students.  [SEP]  The Home of the Future The future is unexpectable and human beings are afriad of dangers, such as tornado or earthquake. Thinking about home like a place to live, is not already worth. We must think about home from other point of view. We need to make our home a place where we want to come back  after the work or school. It has to be  pleasure to be there for us. What we really need in the next millenium is love, that is what will keep all  family together and forever. Do we care about a new carpet or a fashionable furniture? No; I do not think so. Live is too short to think about the poscesives. The houses will change because of new technologe, what may make our live more comfortable. Everything will be faster. We will  used to that. What depends on us, is how  atmospher we will have in our houses. The home of the Future, for me, is a place of hapinest. We cannot  aware  future technologe, but we might still have some feelings to eachothers. ",27.00
8," Dear Clark, I am writing to you because I would like to give my personal opinion about the 'international arts festival.' First of all I have to say that the whole festival was a greatful success and I also think you chose an appropriate title for the leaflet. However, there are some points which can be improved for the next year. To begin with, you wrote down in the leaflet that stars and artists from around the world could be seen in the performance in fact their were only six countries involved. My suggestion for this point is to invite more people from different countries. Furthermore is that some concert halls were definitely to small or in other words to many people attended those concerts. This kind of problem you could avoid when you look for big halls at the begining. Another point where you could improve is when you show more plays and films next year. Nearly at the end of this letter I have to say that the idea with the weekend ticket was really good because it gave to the people the opportunity to attemp  a whole weekend for a cheap price. To finish this letter with I would like to give you a good idea for next year. In my opinion it would be nice if you create an exhibition place where the guests can try to play different instruments. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  How can you earn money in your spare time? I think everybody will ask himself this question one day or has already asked it. Anyway the people where asked this question probably found out that it isn't so easy to earn money or that it is sometimes to much work. A traditional way to earn money, in the spare time, is to bring newspapers or magazines to the families in your town or village. The problems that you have here is the weather. For example when it is rainy, because then everything get wet. Another suggestion is that you go to your cinema and ask if they need your help for changing the film rolls, for cleaning the toilets or to do some other small jobs. But in the case that you really want to do some interesting work in your spare time you should try to sell something where you're good at, I mean if you're interested in computers you should try to provide your service for other people. Of course in the begining it is hard but you can learn a lot and if you're good at  you'll also earn some money. Okay don't wait, there where you're good at and begin. ",34.00
879," Dear Helen Ryan, In response to your letter that I have just received I am writing to give you all the further information you need. According to your letter, I should tell you when I would like to travel and I think July is the best time for me because I will be on summer vacations so I would not have to miss any classes. About the accomodation, I would prefer  tents because I enjoy the contact with nature as well as camping activities. As I may choose the two activities I would like to practise during my staying at the Camp from the list given in your letter, I choose singing and photography. I have been taking singing classes since I was ten years old so I am pretty good at it. On the other hand, I am a beginner in photography skills. I would appreciate  if you could inform me if I have to bring any money for extra costs or even  special kind of clothes for those activities. Thanks in advance for your assistance. Yours sincerely CATARINA PONTES  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable These days people have been shopping more often than they used to. Sometimes shopping can be a stressing experience though people think of it as an enjoyable part of their lives. First of all, shopping can be a good thing if it is a possibility to forget about all the problems you have, even if it is just for a moment. It relieves you from the pressure of life while you are looking for something to buy. On the other hand, sometimes you can get really nervous about shopping like when you have to deal with unhelpful shop assistants. It is a very common fact these days and you have to be patient if you really want to buy something. Furthermore, sometimes you can not find a variety of goods and you eventually buy a low quality product. In conclusion, like all things in life, shopping can be pleasent or irritating depending on your patience and on your mood that day. ",34.0
1149," Chêne-Bourg, Tuesday 12th June. Dear Mrs Smith, it is with great regret that I hear of Mr Brown's illness, and  hope to see him soon in an excellent health. Nevertheless, I am both pleased and honoured to expect you and your group in the context of our international meeting. We have made arrangements for you to stay at the Palace Hotel. Furthermore, since it is located between the airport and our location, a bus shuttle has been organised to pick all our guests from the hotel to the conference room. The end-of-conference party is to be held at the 'Royal Room' of the hotel, which has an outstanding reputation for its quality and seriousness. Therefore, all  guests will be asked to wear the corresponding clothes in order to be accepted. As for the three hours of free time, I strongly suggest you to check-in your lugages at the airport and then, after a five-minutes bus ride, spend your time in the marvellous 'Old City'. Best Regards,  [SEP]  My fair Mobile Phone. The technological revolution taking place today can be directly linked to the amazing evolution of our communication abilities throughout those last  years. The inevitable invention symbolizing this aspect in our ordinary life is, of course, the mobile phone. It is clear and irrefutable that the use of this invention has becomed a necessary condition in some professional activities. Trades, politicians and taxi drivers are but a few examples of such needs. However, the common man seems to ignore how important and useful a mobile phone becomes, when in the hands of a high-school student. It becomes then a real obsession for the average students, as e uses it before the lessons, during the lessons, during lunch and, especially, during examinations... Nevertheless, it is also a common mistake to believe that the sole purpose of such an usage is to communicate information during an exam, since its major role is actually to allow the student and the parents to discuss during everyday's courses. Bottom line is that any teacher complaining about this situation should confiscate not the student's phone, but his parents'! ",26.00
0," Dear Ms Jane Clark, Recently I visited an arts festival, organized with your help. I enjoyed it very much and I think the idea of its creation  is great. However, I have some proposals about its improving next year. At first, I propose  to invite stars and artists not from all  the world, but from only six countries. This change will give   opportunity to create some different performance. The second my proposition is about  classic concerts. I suppose that some concert halls are too small, so you should be sure about it  in advance. This year I noticed that there were only  few plays and films. From my point of view, there should be more films because this part of the festival is interesting for people. And, at last, I should congratulate you with the decision of making one weekend ticket for all events. I support this idea which is convinient both for  people and  organisators. I hope you will consider my proposals. I am looking forward for this festival next year. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Dear Ana, Thanks for your letter and postcard. It was really nice . The things you wrote about in your letter are quite common for me, because we, actually, have some problems about our rules. At first, about school. I'm really fed up with our school forne! It is awfull! And the problem is that nobody wants to wear it. That's why our headmaster is really angry. Off course, if we had such pretty forne like yours, we would wear it with pleasure. But it's impossible at the moment. What should I say  you about home... We are quite  friendly family, that's why we actually don't have some special rules. However, we promised our perents to make  cleaning up every week. This is all I wanted to write  you about rules. I miss you very much. I'm looking forward to see you next summer after my exams. Write  me  what do you think about it. Kisses to your family, ",25.00
109," 17, June 2000 The manager The Circle Theatre Sir, I returned very unhappy from my holidays. The reason is that the musical show that I had seen with my wife, first of all, started late. We bought tickets for the second show, that was at 19.30 and it started at 20:15! We were interested on see the actors that appeard on the tickets and I was very disappointed when, in the show, we saw another actors. The tickets were more expensive than we had expected, but we didn't care because we saw in the tickets that  will be discounts for it, but, they didn't make us discounts! With all this problems, the only thing that led us, was  to eat something. When the show finished we went to the theatre restaurant and it was closed because people didn't arrived to work that day. So it was the most badly evening that I had ever spend. I asked you to consider all my reasons and turned back my money, I think  is the only thing you can do. Thank you for your comprehension  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. It was saturday night, and I was, with my sister Pat alone in my home. That night I was invited to a great party, but I was punished, and I had to stayed at home with my sister. My parents were out for the weekend. When it was time to go to the party I decided to escape home without telling my sister, unfortunately when I arrived she was waiting  me in my room. When I enter my room she was very happy, because my father will punished me again, of course, she will tell him, but I decided to pay her if she beheaved quietly, she accepted and I payed her a lot of money. At sunday night, when my parents arrived, they asked her if I had stayed at home on saturday, my sister beheave silence for a minute and then started laughing; so my parents, with her laugh, know that I had go out that Saturday; and punished me for a year.

1215," 12, June, 2001 Dear Mrs Maria Smith, Thank you for your letter about the international student conference. Here are  answers for your questions. You will stay in the Palace Hotel, which is situated in front of the railway station, Camberley. To get  the conference, you catch the coach No.7 from the station and get off at the Camberley College bus stop. It takes 5 minutes from the station. When you get here, just turn to the left and you will find the stadium where the conference will be held. The end-of-conference party will be held at the cafeteria in the college, which is next to the stadium. It starts at 18 p.m. and ends at 22 pm. We will prepare traditional English meals and some students from foreign country will prepare their ethnic foods. There is a museum next to the Camberley Station, which has  good collection of paintings and potteries, and it would be a good place for you to spend your free time. Instead, there are a lot of shops around there, you can buy souvenirs. I am looking forward to meeting you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  To: Student from the United States From: Juli The aim of this report is to describe the Haunted Castle in Camberley. Place This castle is situated in the centre of the town and surrounded by woods. Inside of the castle is always dark even in  daytime. Story It is 500 years old, and it is said to be haunted by a lady ghost. She appears occationaly and opens every window in the castle. It is believed that she was a nanny who worked there and fell out of the window. People said she was seeking something and  still seeking  even if she had dead for 500 years. Conclusion The ghost story may not be true, but it has good furniture of  16th century, and the castle itself is very beautiful. I think it is worth while to see . I hope you'll enjoy visiting there.

1100," Dear Mr Robertson Thank you for the programme you have organised for our visit to London. We think it will be a very interesting trip, especially the sightseeing by bus. In our class, we have read an advertisement for the ""London Fashion and Leisure Show"", which will take place at the Central Exhibition Hall in London on Tuesday 14 March from 10:00 to 19:00. As we are going to be in London on this date, we think, it could be a great oppurtunity for us to go there because we are very interested in the latest fashions, make up, etc. and it is free for students. Because of this reasons, we would kindy ask you to change the programme, so that we could go to this especial event. We suggest visiting the Science Museum in the afternoon on Wednesday 15 March and canceling the Shopping on Tuesday 14 March. Hoping on your agreement and looking forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  An especiall invitation It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. I was having  holidays with my parents and some friends in India and we were enjoying talking to people and eating the local food. One day we were invited from  locals to visit a little town five hours away from New Dehli. Although my parents were very happy of having such an especial opportunity  visiting a place with no tourists, I was a little bit scared. In this country my parents used to buy water in bottles to have it clean, but in the little town we didn't had this possibility and the family where we were staying with, kindly boiled the water for us. We spent 2 weeks with the family. The first week was find, but on the second week I got very seek. I think it was the water. My mother tried to get a doctor, but they said there was no one. Some days later we went back to Dehli and having being to the doctor and having again  bottled water, I was feeling healthy again. ",34.00
833," Dear Helen Ryan, I am writing to reply  your letter saying that I have won the competition, which I can't believe. I am so excited by the news. I think I can take this opportunity in July because I run my shop all year round except three weeks in July. I would like to have accommodation in log cabins as I find sleeping in tents very uncomfortable thought it may be a new experience. It would be nice to have a chance to try  new sport when we are relaxed. I'd like to try golf because I'm not good at any other sports. Besides golf, taking wonderful photographs of sceneries has been my dream, even though I am a beginner. I'd like to ask about what clothes we need, what the weather is like and whether we need some spending money or not. I'm looking forward to going on this fantastic holiday. Yours sincerely.  [SEP]  Dear Kim, How are you? I know you have been waiting for my letter. But as you know, I have been so busy that I couldn't write earlier. Actually I didn't use to enjoy pop music much. My classmate Cecilia persuaded me to try  whole new experience of helping at a pop concert. I thought it would be the last thing I wanted, but it wasn't. I've really enjoyed this opportunity. We delivered so many fantastic and gorgeous costumes which had been designed exclusively by top designers. We also helped to make posters and leaflets, which I enjoyed most as I always like drawing and designing. The most difficult work was to arrange  coach trip to the concert hall as there were many audience from  countryside. It was too complicated. But the rest of the preparation was so good. I've realised pop stars are just like us, down to earth. They were so kind and modest. Do you know what I liked most from this experience? I've found pop music so wonderful, it changed my idea of that classic music is always best. Of course, I've enjoyed being around famous singers, too. Love ",34.0
932," Dear Mrs Helen Ryan, I am very happy to have won the first prize of the competition, and I am going to clear up some details you asked me  in your letter. Firstly, because of my school exam, I would like to travel only  july. Moroever, I have chosen this month because I think the weather will be fine. At Camp California, I hope I will be in  tents because I like very much this kind of style life: I love the contact with the nature. On the other handDuring my stay in Camp California, I want to go swimming because I practice this activitie regularly and I often do competitions: this is one of my hobbies. In addition to this, I wish I am going to sail: I have never try it, but it seems to be great! Finally, I have two questions more: I wonder if I can change my french money in the Camp and what kind of clothes I have to buy before coming? Yours sincerely. Didier Bovie  [SEP]  Dear Kim, As you asked me in your last letter, I am going to tell you more about the last month's pop concert. Firstly, I arrived five hours before the begining of the concert in order to help the musicians to move the material from the van to the scene. As soon as all the conections was made, we tested the nivel of the sound: I found it too loud, so I advised them to regular it, and they listed to me! Then, there was only one hour left to install the differents color lights: it was just enought time. Thus, it was a fantastic afternoon because I like very much music, even if I don't play any music instrument. Moreover, I learnt a lot about music, especially concerning the way of using an instrument. Consequently, I hope I will play an instrument in the future, especially because the group promises me to help me to learn any instrument. See you soon. Best wishes Didier Bovie ",27.0
92," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing this letter to complaint about the musical show that  Circle Theatre company played  few days ago. Anything the advertisement said was correctly done. The first thing that annoyed me were the forty-five minutes we were waiting for the beginning. It is a great fault of responsability for a theatre like yours to have a delay like this one. Secondly, an other point that disappointed me was the actor that played the main role. He was not Danny Brook, and the main reason that I came to see this show was the possibility to see him acting. I am a fan of him. When I went to get the ticket, and the women said me that the discounts were not available I knew that it wouldn't be a good night. Finally, the restarant were I would like to have dinner with friends after the show was closed against what was announced in the advertisement. Nobody told us about the reasons of the problems. These are the reasons why I am complaining, and I would like to know if there will be some money back. I will be waiting  news from you. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Perhaps, modern technology has changed my life style but I don't think so because I was born in the period of modern developments. Since I was born I have lived involved of technological instruments like personal computers, mobile phones, television, etc. And the development of them doesn't worries me, like people  against technology. The only thing I can say about technology is that  has driven my life. Modern technology attracts my atention, and this is the reason why I have chosen an electronic caree. I think technology doesn't change the life style. Is the life style or necessities from people what make technology develop. All kind of industrial machines are created to solve problems, improve other machines or to don't waste so many time. But these ones bring new problems that must be solved by others. ",24.0
254," 17th June 2000 Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing with reference to Over the Rainbow  musical show which I went to see at the Circle Theatre last night. Being a theatre lover, I am always looking forward to seeing new musicals, but unfortunately, this particular one was very disappointing. First of all, Danny Brook was not starring, even  it was stated in your advertisement , but the main role was played by an unknown actor. Secondly, I had to wait for forty five minutes for the show to start, and it was 20:15 (not 19:30) when the curtain went up. Another disappointing thing was that I could not get any student discount, even that your advertisement promised them. To make things even worse, the theatre restaurant was closed after the show, because of the roof repairs. As you can see I had a very disappointing evening - the worst one during my week's holiday in London. I would like therefore to have my money back, so please send me a cheque for £20 to pay the address above. Yours faithfully, Katja Menan.  [SEP]  Fashion of the Future. Almost everyone is trying to be fashionable and look modern. Every season we can see  arrival of new styles, fabrics and proportions. Let's try to imagine, what will clothes be like 100 years from now? I think in the future people will express themselves by wearing appropriate clothes. There will be  mixture of styles from different times of the past, so if you feel like a medieval princess, you can dress like one. A new technology and science will change fabrics, so they will change their colour during the day. In the future people will be even more concerned with pollutions and harmful UV-rays. So their clothes will have built-in protective filters to help them keep healthy. With so many choices shopping for clothes is going to be even greater fun than it is now. Fashion of the future will not be the same as today's, but it will be more exciting and fun! ",33.0
971," Dear Madam I am writing to answer the informations that you need from me. First I would like to thank you for doing this competition and I would also like to thank you for the prize. Answering your questions, I would like to travel only en July because this is the month of my vacations. In July I will be free to travel anywhere I please. According to your letter I have two options of accommodation, or in tents or log cabins. I would prefer in tents because I think that is something more exciting and new for me. I never stayed in  tents in the middle of nowhere, in my life so I would prefer something more realistic and new. Log cabins may be more confortable, on the other hand I think that I will be able to ""survive"" in  tents. Looking to your letter, I can see many options of activities and I realized that I like most of them. I think I would prefer Climbing and Painting. The reason of choosing this two activities is that they contrast  itselves, I want one  more exciting and that asks for more agility and another  more calm and relaxing, that asks only for my ability to paint. Climbing is something new for me and I am not so good on that, however I wish that I can learn about it on the Camp. Painting is something that I love and I am very good doing it. I have some doubts about my prize and travel. Is there a possibility that you  send me a list of material and clothes that I have to take? Is all  the travel already paid  including food and meals, or  I have to bring some money? Do I have to bring something especial for the tents and camping? Please answer my letter as soon as is possible. Your faithfully, GUSTAV SOARES.  [SEP]  Dear Kim, How are you? Is everything good in  USA? I'm writing to you because I had a wonderful experience last month. There was a concert of a famous band here in my city. I vish you were here with me. So, I went with my friend to the concert with a lot of fans. We bought tickets to the show and also to the fan's bus. Yes, there is a bus that take you to the concert and bring you back. The concert was going to start at 22:00 and the bus arrived at my house at 18:00. When we entered inside of it, we saw a lot of fans using T-shirts, caps and shouting, ""Almendegos, Almendegos..."" (that is the name of the band). AT 20:00, we stopped in a coffee house to eat. The shouted: ""20:30 you all have to be back because the bus will leave."" We sat and started to eat and talk. Suddenly a man came and started to tell us his adventures. They were very interesting and we liked him so much. After a few minutes (I fought  were  few) I realized that the coffee house was empty. I looked to my watch: 20:45. The bus had left about fifteen minutes . The man offered  a ride. We accept. You can not imagine how dissapointed I were with my ownself. When we arrived the concert had already began. When we were running to enter a man called us. He was helping to put the materials of the concerts (microphone...) on the stage. He asked if we could help. We answered: ""Yes!"" We started to put everthing on the stage and after this we realized that the band was entering into the stage near us. By my side the vocal of the Almendegos was and he touched my arm. I will never wash my arm again. After all of this we saw the show in the best place, near of the stage and after, the thing that I most liked, we were convidated to see the group and had their signatures. That was the best night of my life. I wish that you liked my experience. Kisses, GUSTAV. ",27.0

503," Dear Sir or Madam I am writing to complain about the musical show ""over the rainbow"". I recently booked a week's holiday in London to see the musical ""over the rainbow"" the date was the 9th of June 2000. from your firm. It was said that Danny Brook should play the leading part, but there was a different actor instead. This made me really disappointed. We arrived at the theatre at 19,00 since the play should start at 19:30 but we had to wait until 20:15 then it started. It was also said that discounts was available but this was wrong, because we couldn't get any discounts. The theatre Restaurant that should be open after the show was closed because the chief was ill and there was no food in the fridge. This should have been our perfect evening out but it wasn't. I am not satisfied with this musical show at all. I am therefor writing to ask for a full refund I am expecting to receive a cheque for £20.

She realised that telling Pat was a very bad idea but now it was done. Pat was so happy the whole day and wanted to tell her mother but Maria told her not to. Maria was still a little bit chocked over the naus of having a baby. She and her husband Peter had been trying for so long and now they had succeeded. Many weeks went by and Maria and Pat didn't say a word about it. The rest of the family understood that something was wrong because Pat started to buy baby clothes. Which was very chooking for her mother. One day when they all sat down at the kitchen table for having their lunch Pat said, - ""Maria and Peter are going to have a baby""! The End. ",26.0

I met a lot of famous pop bands for the first time. I would feel sad if I didn't go there. They gave me a concert printed T-shirt. I'll show you by photographs. From that time I had a lot of friends also some of them are old friends from college. So we are still keep in touch. And  next concert we were promised we'll be there again. I wish you were there with us. Because sometimes you wouldn't have known the experience until you had done it. Any way I will sent you some photographs. I hope to hear back from you. Take care and don't work too hard. Please send my love to your family. Best wishes ",25.0
943," Dear Sir, Thank you for your letter and for having inform me about the results of the competition. I also want to congratulate you for your exellent competition, thank to which I have the opportunity to go to California, a place that I always wanted to go . About the travel, I think it would be preferable to do it on July, which is a holiday periode and so I won't have any special obligations. While in California I would prefer to sleep in a tent, so I can live closer to the nature. Anyway the accommodation is not a big problem for me, because I will be away most of the time. Stay a lot of time in the same place in my opinion is the worse thing to do, specialy during a trip! Moreover  would like  if it is possible to have an opportunity to play tennis and basketball. Any little tournaments of this kind would be greateful. Before ending my letter I would like to know and be told specialy in what kind of clothes should I have to take with me and also if you could change some money of mine in Dollars. I look forward to hearing from you Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Dear Kim, As you know last month I went to help at a concert, the one that I told you  in my last letter. I wanted to go very much there and so go there for helping was for me a unique chance. Moreover instead of bying a ticket I entered there for free, as a helper. From the first time that  went there I understood that I was going to have a great night. OK in the beginning the other helpers and I had a lot of work to do, so as cleaning the stage and so some decoration work. But as the correct started and we finished what we had to do, we were free to do what ever we wanted. So the party started... The pop concert was exellent and I had a lot of fun. Don't ask the time in which I come home because I don't remember! Some of my friends who were also helping told me that we returned at six o'clock in the morning! It was really an unforgettable experience. Best whishes Giannis ",25.0
382," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing in connection with the musical show your theatre company has presented recently, and, I want you to know, it has really disappointed me. To begin with, the actor the advertisement showed did not come, which I found it in very bad taste,  disappointing. Moreover, the show started at a quarter past eight, forty-five minutes later than it might have been. I paid twenty pounds for my ticket because, as you may know, there were not  discounts available. It is for this reason, I think you should return me some money back. To sum up, I would like to make my point about what happened in the restaurant after that. It was closed because its owner had decided to go on holiday. However, nobody told me. I think you would have to take it into consideration to avoid it happens again. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. If I had know it before, I would have never told her, because then, that was really important for me, but, anyway, presently, it doesn't really matter  me. By the time, Pat and me had a close relationship. I explained her everything it happened to me and vice versa. We had many points in common and we knew each other as if we were sisters. However, one day our friendship was broken down. I told her I was falling in love with my best friend and she decided to explain it everybody in our group, despite knowing that  must be a secret. When I met Caballos, my best friend, I felt embarassd and disappointed and I couldn't say anything. I was at a loss. Now I wish all of this had never happened, while I try to forget it laughing with Caballos and Pat. ",28.0
801," Dear Helen Ryan. Thank you for your letter. I am so happy to win the prize and come true my dream. I would like to travel to California this July, because I can take an holiday from 14th to 27th of July. I would prefer log cabins. I have never used it and I think it would be more exciting than tents. I have heard that the Camp California is famous for surfing, so I hope that I will enjoy surfing for the first time. Besides, I will take the chance to play golf. It is my only favorite hobby. What about clothes and money? I don't know what the weather is like, and you are paid for travel costs, but I am wondering that it is included two activities. Also, I have a dog. Can I go with him. Please, let me know  this questions as soon as possible. I appreciate your competition and I look forward to hearing your answer Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Kim I am sorry. This letter is late, because last week I took exams, so I was very busy. To reply  your answer, it was realy an nice experience. As you know, I like a pop music so much and  singer was one of my favorite singers. Also, in the future I'll want to be an organizer like  this concert, so it'll be useful the experience to me. I am writing  how I got the position and what I did. Firstly, I applied to a concert agency to help, because I had the experience before and I knew how to organize and what to do. In the pop concert, there were many people, so before starting the pop concert, I arranged the seats and carried some musical instruments. It was somewhat hard to me. After the concert, I cleaned all the ground with other helpers and we moved the seats again. If you have some questions, let me know. I am looking forward to hearing from you With best wishes, ",28.0
504," Dear Sir: I am writing to let you know  the disappointed evening I had seen your show with the worst services I have ever seen. First of all, in the ticket for entrance  says that the actor was Danny Brook and realy he was not. In the show apears a different actor, so I was very disappointed. Then, in the ticket  says that the show started at 19.30 and, I don't know why, it started at 20:15, very unpolited of your side, and also,  make me lose time. Other thing is that in the ticket  apears that discounts were available but when I asked for it, there was no one. The last thing is that you invited us to visit your restaurant after the show, but it was closed because the food was not already done. I thought you were a good theatre, were people can go and have a good evening alone or with somebody else, but realy I am very disappointed and I want to ask for my money back. I'll never return again because of the bad service you ofer. Please, let me know your answer. Truely.  [SEP]  All of us know the technology and science has affected our lives. Seen my hole life I can say the moden technology has changed my daily life in many ways. The first way is that it has changed my family's relationship. It has, in some way, separated the family's life, making all of us be worried about ower own things. We work all separated, making grow the individuality and forgoten we has to talk all together to know about the other's life. The second way is that it has make easy my life. The comunications in the world are faster than ever, so when I need something, I can have it in only a minute. It allowed me to worry about other things of the life. The last way in that the technology has allowed me to have a better health. It has descover many instruments that help me to have a good health. To finish, I can say technology has changed my life in good and bad ways, helping the things be easier but making me develop a big independence. ",20.0
103," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to complain about your entertainment which was advertised in the last edition of ""Plays"". I am afraid that reality had nothing common with the things I suspected to meet. First of all, the prices weren't lower in any cases although you advertised the information like that. Then, I expected the show to start on time, but it turned out that I had to wait 45 minutes. Moreover, when the play started at last, I couldn't look at the actors. Especially I was disappointed by Danny Brook who made me nervous with his lack of talent. According to your advertisement, there was a possibility to have dinner in your restaurant, but I was surprised when I found it closed. After that, I should also mention, that this evening was dull, boring and the worst in my life. I am looking forward to hearing from you and I insist that you refund my lost money at once. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Come back to paradise There is no doubt that fashion affects people and makes them obsessed with this subject, but what can be designed more? Can you imagine the trend which will be as shocking as it has never been? The clothes is part of each culture and one of these things which expresses our taste and personality. People spend a lot of money to buy something extraordinary, feel comfortable and stand out. They come up with many ideas but it can't last for a long time. Nowadays it's getting obvious that designers sold only details, but significant changes don't turn up. Styles mix, colours and shapes come back from the past,  only the fabrics are different. People look for something new but it is not so easy to be creative all the time. Teenagers are bored with casual fashion and their parents laugh at them because of the fact they wear common clothes. That's why I believe in the solution which is the closest to human nature and can help us to omit the boredome I am sure that at last we will take off our clothes and in the future we will be undressed and free there won't be any problem with being up-do-date. As it was previously stated I am convinced that the reality will turn out to be a paradise where the most important  will be  body and  purity of our soul. ",32.0
266," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to complain about some problems I had when I went to the Circle Theatre two weeks ago. Firstly, Danny Brook and Tina Truelove were supposed to perform in the show but instead of them different actors performed badly. Secondly, the show should have had started at 19:30 but it started later, at 20:15. The Theatre also promised discounts, which were not available, so I had to pay the full amount. I also wanted to visit the Theatre Restaurant after the show, but it was impossible because it closed at 20:30 and the show finished at 21:00 Finaly, I would like to ask you  £20 back as I was not satisfied with your services. I hope you pay attention to my complains. I would not like to take legal action, as it would not be convenient for both of us, but I will if I consider it necessary. I will be looking forward to hearing from you. Yours Faithfully  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets but she was my best friend and I had to tell someone what had happened to me. So I phoned her and told her the whole story. Last weekend in the Local Festival, that is held every year in our Town, I was walking with my little sister, who is three years old. She started running and got lost. So while I was looking for her I saw the Director of my school, Mr Smythe, stealing money from a small shop. I could not believe my eyes! When Mr Smythe saw me there, he told me: ""If you say a word you're going to be in serious trouble."" But Pat could not resist the temptention of calling the police. We were at school when she told me this and Mr Smythe went to our class and said to me ""May I talk to you?"". In that moment I felt so nervous and terrified that I faint. When I came around Mr Smythe was under arrest and fortunately,  thing finished well for me. ",34.0
623," Dear Ms. Ryan, I have just received your letter and I am writing to give you further information about myself. First of all, July is the only month I can travel in because I will have to start working from August, and I would like to stay in a tent when I am at the Camp so that I can enjoy the great atmosphere which tents only can make and I love. I would also like to tell you which two activities I am keen to do at the Camp. One of them is basketball, which I have been playing for over seven years, and I am the captain of my university basketball team. The other one is tennis, which is also my favorite sports and I have been playing for several years. I go to elementary school to teach children how to play tennis every Wednesday and Friday. I am therefore writing to enquire about some things. What I would like to know is what the weather is like so that I can bring appropriate clothes and also how much money I should bring. Lastly, I would like to know how many people are comming to the Camp I will go . I sould be grateful if you would send me  further information that I asked  and I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely, Makoto Tanaka  [SEP]  For a short video Introduction The aim of this report is to summarize the results of a survey about lessons and other activities which should be filmed. This report is based on a sample of over 80 students of my school. Favorite lessons Interestingly, over half of the students who were asked enjoy attending history class, while 30 per cent are keen to take an art and music class, and a small number of the student (less than 15 per cent) like to take social studies class. Favorite activities Not surprisingly, football was well-preferred as an activity which students do after school generally (over 30 per cent) and also about 25 per cent preferred baseball. Amazingly, over 20 per cent of the students would like to take up handball from next year. Conclusion To sum up, it seems that there are so many interesting lessons and activities at our school, ",29.0
981," Dear Ms Ryan, Thank you for your letter. I was pleasantly surprised that I have won the first prize in your competition. Firstly, I would like to answer your questions. As I am doing my A-levels exams at the moment and they continue until the 30th of June and my further studies start in August, I can only travel in July. I would prefer to stay in a tent. It will give me an adventure feeling and I have always prefered tents to log cabins. I enjoy basketball very much and I am quite good at it. I would like to play this game at your camp. I have never tried out climbing, but I have always wished to do it one day. Would it be possible to do this activity at your camp as a beginner? Secondly, I would like to ask you for some information. Would you be kind enough to tell me which kind of clothes I should bring with me? Could you possibly tell me how much money I might spend at California Camp? Would you recommend me to bring some equipment, like a rope, sticks, with me? Thank you in advance for your help. I look forward to receiving your prompt reply. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Kim, Hi, how are you? I'm actually fine at the moment, but have to study a lot because of my exams in English. You asked me to wite about my experience which I made by helping at the pop-concert. And I can say it was terrific! My job was actually to listen to Tim and do whatever he said. This included to clean up the rooms which were used by the singers and put some equipment on the stage. Tim was in charge of organising this concert. I had never been behind the stage before and you know the rooms, in which singers dress and  make-up, are actually small. Can you imagine, I could stay at this concert without paying anything! And I managed to speak to Ricky Martin out of stage. O.K., I actually asked him only: 'How are you?' and he gave me his signature. He was fantastic, you know that he is my favourite singer. I think this was my best job as a student in Cambridge. Probably it wasn't so nice to do jobs which you were told to do, but you see many stars out of stage. And you might manage to speak to some pop-stars. Beside this, I earned some money, not a lot but enough for me. Well I'll have to close now. Give my regards to your parents. Looking forward to hearing from you soon. With love, ",37.0
17," Dear Miss , I am writing to suggest some idea for the International Art Festival next year. I have just been there and noticed some points which could make the festival better. First of all, the festival was a great idea. There were a number of stars and artists from around the world, but from only six countries. Secondly, they held some concerts, but some  concert halls were so small that there was not enough space for  the people. Thirdly, it was nice to see several plays and films. We would be pleased if you could have more. Fourthly, everyone seems to have enjoyed seeing  dance shows and the art exhibitions and listening to the talks. Lastly, the weekend ticket was excellent because it was quite reasonable. However, a ticket for each event is expensive. I suggest you have a oneday ticket or a reasonable ticket for every event. That is everything I have noticed about the festival. I would be grateful if you could think about it. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Sharyl, Thank you for your letter. I really enjoyed reading it. I'm very happy to know you're pretty well. Speaking of rules, most of them are annoying! There're plenty of rules in my high school. For example, girls must keep the length of the skirt by 5 cm under their knees. That's so stupid! It doesn't bother studying, does it? And also we're not allowed to bring any sweets. I know some rules are necessary to control the students. The school uniform is a good example. And the advantage of this is I don't need to think about what to put on every morning! In my house, I'm allowed to do anything unless it bothers somebody. But there's one thing I can't stand up. I'm not allowed to go out late at night. I want to go dancing sometimes. You're allowed to do that, aren't you? That's wonderful! I'm really jealous of you! Take care. I'll write to you soon! Love, ",31.00
529," Dear Manager, I saw your advertisment of your show in the circle theatre, over the rainbow. I went to it, but I was really disappointed about some thing. First the musical show, Over the Rainbow started at 20:15, and in the advertisement  was written  at 19:30, then  also was written that the actor was Danny Brook, but in the show appeared a different actor, that was really disappointing. Also  was written in the advertisment that some discounts were available, but there wasn't  discounts. And because of the time that the show started I couldn't went to the theatre restaurant because it was closed. Mr, I was very disappointed with the show so I want my money back, and I am sure you will understand my reasons. Yours Faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, and she went to her house to speak about the things I had told her. First she said to her father, then to her mother and finally to her brother, that I was from another planet called Orion, that was a billion kilometer distance of Earth and that I was so ashamed because I have been his boyfriend since I have came to Earth. My confession caused a disaster in the life of her and her family, and they called the police to take me out of the planet or  arrested, so that I can't see her again. The police caught me, when I was peacefully in my room, and put me covered with something, in a car. After they caught me I think they brought me to the Area 57, were the police do experiments. Since then I live in Area 57, and this is my diary life. I don't now when I and going to be free, for going to my planet. ",23.0
395," Dear Sir or Madam, I'm writing to complain about the service you'd offered me last Saturday evening at The Circle Theatre. I've read your advertisement and it didn't say the truth. There weren't any discount available as you'd assured  in the add. I think you should check the information before print it! I arrived at the right time (19.30) that evening but the play, which was 'Over The Rainbow', started almost an hour later. And nobody told me why! When the play began I realised that the main actor had been changed and the new one wasn't good at all. I couldn't visit the theatre after the performance because it was closed for reparations. Why didn't you say something about it? I didn't have the 'perfect evening out' you'd promised so I want to ask for my money back because your service was terrible. Please answer my letter as soon as possible. I'll be looking forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully, Marcella, Scalia C.  [SEP]  'How Has Modern Technology Changed My Daily Life?' This is not a simple question because I got used to dealing with technology since I was a child but I'm going to try to explain  you how . I didn't have a computer until I was eight. Then my brother and I started to develop a new ability. In that time I used the computer only to play with its video games. When I was thirteen I discovered a completely different use for my computer. It became scencial to do my homework. And years later it enabled me to get a very good job. One day my mother got a terrible disease. She had to be operated on and my family and I were very scared. But when we talked to the doctor we felt more relaxed because he answered us that the operation was a very simple one. I think that if my mother had got ill ten years before, she wouldn't survive. The modern technology is better now than what it used to be. What do you think about this? I'm sure that these arguments have explained my point of view, haven't they? Now I would like to have your point of view. ",28.0
261," Dear Mr. Brown, My name is Anne Singler and I have already watched the musical ""Over the rainbow"" in the Circle Theatre. I'm writing to you because I wasn't pleased with the show! In your advert for the musical show you promised the newest and best musical show, but it wasn't. First I was very disappointed about the price of the ticket because I expected to pay a smaller pice than £20 for my six year old daughter. Then the show already started at 20:15 and not at 19:30! I was quite bored, sitting in my chair and waiting for the beginning of the show. For me the most disappointing problem was that the starring Danny Brook wasn't there. My husband was also looking forward to seeing Mr. Brook as an actor of your musical because he is one of his greatest fans. The actor which acted instead of Danny Brook wasn't as good as Mr. Brook. After the show, which wasn't really the best I have ever seen, my family and I wanted to get some snacks in the theatre restaurant. When we arrived at the restaurant we had to realize that it was closed because the cook was ill. After this last point of troubles we went home with only bad remembers of this evening. So I want to ask you for giving me my money back because I think I  have better  spent my money on anything else. I hope you understand my point of view and write back. Yours,  [SEP]  The secret Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. One day her best friend Sally told her that she had betrayed her boyfriend. Pat was really shocked to hear this but she had to promise Sally to keep quiet. Pat really liked chatting about others and so she wasn't able to keep quiet about Sally's secret. She told it to her boyfriend Paul. After that Paul got white in his face, he was pale like a wall and it seemed as he would be very nervous. Pat couldn't understand Paul's reaction and so she didn't care about it. Some weeks later when Pat was walking to school she met Sally, which just came out of Paul's house. Now Pat realized what was going on and could undstand why her boyfriend got so nervous about the secret. He was Sally's lover! In this moment Pat wished that she never would have been keen on knowing secrets! ",29.0

Everything was perfect and beautiful till yesterday. Yesterday I wanted to go to the theatre to see a musical show. I went to the theatre to see at what time was the show, 19.30, it was O.K. so I bought a ticket. In that moment my problems began. I couldn't get any discount; that mean, that the advertisement was wrong, but I bought the ticket anyway. Then I had to wait 45 mins, the show started at 20:15. Then Danny Brook wasn't acting, it was a different actor. In that moment I was realy angry, so to calm down I went to the theatre restaurant, but it was closed, because of its bad cleaning and food. That was too much. ""Dear"" manager I hope you to understand me, so I ask for money back and I hope this wont happen again. By  [SEP]  First of all I think we have grown  with the technology. It's difficult for us to realize the changes in our live, but we can think about it. How has it change my daily life? Well, in one word it made my life comfortabler. Now I only used to push a button, and things or mashines work on their own. Homework is easer to find in the cumputer than in a book sometimes. Everything is faster, and sometimes technology go so fast that I'm unable to follow it. Modern technology showed us that we could do anything we wanted to, and it make us thing more about my future job. Maybe, I won't be able to understand how the things worked and that scare me, I will be useless, because a mashine will do all the work. ",26.0
75,"  Dear Sir I'm writting to express my feeling and opinion about the International Arts Festival which held a few days ago. When I found the advertisement of  International Arts Festival, I was very excited. It is great to hold an annual international arts festival in the place. Then I spent two days at the festival. I enjoyed it very much. There were so many exciting things I saw, such as stars and artists from around the world. Jazz, rock and classical concerts, plays and dance show etc. The specified thing  is worth to remind here is the reasonably-priced ticket for all events, it is excellent because most tourist could offer what they like. Although how I enjoyed it, there were still something  needed to be improved. For example, there were some conert halls which was too small to hold so much people, the stars and artists were just from six countries, which is not enough for  audience. In the addition when you organize the next year's international arts festival, could you arrange more plays and films. Thanks for reading this letter, I'm looking forward to the next year's festival. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Dear Magda It is lovely to get your letter so soon. You mentioned the rules at home and at school in the letter. This remind me of what I experienced during my teeenage . In my country the children go to the secondary school when they are at the first year of  teenage. Your know, this age is the trouble age, boys have too much energy and girls want to fall in love with someone. These always annoy the school teacher and  parents. In a result of these the teachers make very strict rules at school, such as students aren't allowed to speak  each other in the class. They had to finish homework in a limited time. They cannot oppose to the teacher, girls are not allowed to  make up and wear any accessories. At home, in my experience, my parents didn't allow me to go out in the evening and gave me much amsh homework to do, even in the holiday. They also forbidden me to make a boyfriend. I think it is not just what happened in my home many of my friend had the same experience. Now I'm a mother of two children. They are all in the school. Comparing to my experience, I want to give them  more open attitude about everything. I want to be a mother of them and a friend of them. But at school, although I hope the teacher don't give students so much homework,  don't forbidden the opposite voice of the students, there are nothing I can do because of our culture. It's quite sad. I'm looking forward to receiving your next letter soon. Best wishes ",21.00

About the information that you need, I must tell you that I will be able to travel only in July becase I  got a new job and I can't ask for more than one month  holidays each year and on the other months I will be very busy becase my workmates will take holidays on these months. With the accomodation, I would prefered  tents becase it is more according with a camp. And with the activities I must chose Photography and Painting becase I am not very good for sports and I think I am doing well in these things.

Cornel Wales 13th June, 2000 Dear Kim, Here I am, writting  you to tell  everything about my wonderful experience at the concert. You can't imagine How much did I enjoy that journey. I started early in the morning helping to carry the stuff from the trucks to the place where the band played, I help with the music stuff like speakers, mics, lights, sound , etc. And later the band arrived and played two or three times before the concert started. And I was helping them fixing the last details. When the concert started I was preparing some drinks for the band because when the concert finished they were very tired and tersty. After the concert I only help with tidy up the place and made sure that everything was under control and clean. Later the band was talking to me, I could get their new album free, and some other souvenirs from the band. But the thing that particulary liked me was that I could do all kind of things just in one day and I could feel different emotions. So, that's everything that I can tell you, I enjoy  a lot and I hope to have another experience like this. ",27.0
268," Saturday, June, 17th Dear M. White, I went to the Circle theatre last week on monday and I would say that I had a very disappointing evening, there. Firstly, I've read in the advertisement that the actors who were playing that night were D. Brook and T. Truelove. Now you can guess how disappointed I was when I saw that there were different (and worse) actors! Secondly, the musical show started at 20.15 instead of 19.30.. so I had to wait forty-five minutes outside and it was raining cats and dogs! And then I discovered that the discounts were not available for the tickets. Moreover, the theatre restaurant was closed after the show and I was really hungry because I hadn't had my dinner that evening in order to be on time for the show. To sum up, It wasn't a ""perfect evening out"". I'd rather say that it was a catastrophe! And I am really sorry, but consequently I would ask you for some money back. Thank you for considering my request. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Modern technology has completly changed my daily life, which became more comfortable, and easier. For instance, my discman gives me the possibility to listen to music or to the radio everywhere: in the underground, or when I walk in the city. Moreover, it disturbs nobody, and that's great. Another simple example is my mobile telephone; A few years ago, I had to buy a telephone card and then to find a telephone box to call my parents and to tell them that I would be late for dinner, or other stuff like that. Yet my hand phone is in my bag and I bring it everywhere. But I think the best technological invention which changed my life is the internet - Thanks to it, I have  hundred friends all over the world and I know many different cultures. All these examples are very few demonstrations to show how technology could affect our lives nowadays. In my point of view, modern technology is a great thing unless it is used to serve bad intentions. ",32.0
585," Dear Mrs Helen Ryan, i am writing to reply  your questions about me. Firstly, I would like to thank you abut this big opportunity you give me to visit this wonderful place like California. I would like to travel only in July because my boss can not give me a leaving for the other months of Summer. Also, I prefer to stay in  tents because I think it is a good chance for me to live with the nature and to wake up listening birds which  singing. It will be nice! Then you ask me which two activities I want to choose. To tell you the truth, I would prefer to do swimming and singing. I'm good in both of these. I have been swimming for eight years! Also I like a lot music and everybody tells me that I have a good voice. I would like ask you about the weather. I want to know if I should bring warm clothes or not and how much money. Your sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Kim, how are you? Thanks for you letter. It was good to hear from you now. As you know this Summer I really enjoy myself doing things I like a lot. Last month, Alice and her friends proposed  me   to help at a pop concert. The group which was singing was very famous and I was able to meet them and to chat about their plans for the future. All I had to do was to prepare something to eat before the concert and to control during it about the sound. The concert lasted four hours and in the end they wanted to pay me. I didn't want to take any money because I was so happy that I had seen the concert of ""Savage Garden"" in live and because that night was the best of my life. But the thing I particularly liked about my experience, was the feeling when you are near and when you talk with the people so famous. OK! That's all for now. I'm waiting for your letter. See you soon, Margaret xxx P.S. I hope you will find the spare time to visit my country this Summer. ",30.0
339," 17th June 2000 Dear Sir, I would like to complain about a musical show. I was very disappointing  a week holiday for me because I had got a lot of problem with the show. I had seen  the advertisement that the actors were Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, but it was not Danny Brook. I was really disappointing because he is my famous actor. The musical should started at 19.30, but it started at 20.15. When I went to asked for the discount of  ticket in the cashier desk they told me no discount  available for this. I had seen the advertisement say that  discount  available. After the show I decide to had dinner in your theatre restaurant, but I couldn't because it  closed. It closed at 10 pm but the show finished at 10.30 pm. This was not  perfect evening for me, so if you don't give  my money back, I will tell to the newspaper about it. I am looking forward to hear a good new. Yours sincerely, Boo Sersuwan.  [SEP]  I think in the next 100 years people will wear the space clothes with  small engine in the back. because of the atmosphere. The atmosphere in the earth  now starting badly every years. The  carbon dioxide are growing very fast and people cut  more trees, therefore  not enough trees to such carbon dioxide and produce oxygen. The designer will have a lot of idea for how to make very nice and useful clothes. I think if we wear this clothes we will travel to every where easier than we use cars, ships, planes and space ships. This mean the engineering will find the way to useless petrol for it, so it must useful in the future. I think somebody will make a very big area to grow plant because they can sell the oxygen. This is a new business. I think I can win this price, because this clothe will produce in the future soon. ",21.0
555," 13th June 2000 Dear Mrs Ryan, Thank you very much for your letter. I was really surprised and very happy when I read that I have won the first prize. First of all because I have never been to California and second because it's the first time I have ever won something. The only time that  is possible for me to travel is July, because I am working for a bank and this is the only month I can go on holiday. For my stay in California I would prefer the accommodation in tents because this gives me a feeling of freedom and adventure and it is quite different to my live here in Greece. The activities I would like mot to do are climbing and surfing. In my free time I have climbed a lot of mountains in the surrounding area so I can say, that I am quite good in climbing. But I have never 'surfed' in my live, so that is an activity I have to learn. Last but not least there are some things I would like to know: What kind of wheather do you have in California? Is it very hot? What kind of clothes should I bring with me? And what about money? How much money Should I take with me? Are there any activities which are not included? And my last question: how many persons are going to stay in each tent. I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Many people, especially women, love shopping. If you go to the centre of every big town you will see people walking from store to store searching for something to wear or to buy to eat. But shopping is not always enjoyable. First of all because of the big variety in the store. Very often you don't know what to buy because we don't have only three or four different sport shoes to choose from, not, we have to choose out of twenty or thirty such as Nike, adidas or Fila. And very often you have to pay a lot of money for the product you want. Another cause is that shops and stores are often overcrowded. Very often you can hardly move because of the crowds of people. And many people are in a hurry, so don't wonder if other people have not  tolerance and patience to wait and hit you with their shopping cars. Of course there are a lot of other causes why shopping isn't always great fun, but the last cause, which is very important for me is that shopping is becoming more and more impersonal. That means that there are more and more big supermarkets and big stores, where noone has time for you to show you or explain things to you such as what kind of bicycle is the best for me, no one to talk to and noone to complaine . That is the most important reason why I only like to go shopping in little stores, where I have peace and quiet and very often nothing to complaine about. ",33.0
488," Dear Sir, I address this letter to the manager of the theatre. I want to talk to you about an evening I had in your theatre : OVER THE RAINBOW. Your advertisement was excellent and it gave me a lot of enthousiasm. But I had a very disappointing evening and it was because  many points. First point, I didn't see Danny BROOK as starring. I was coming to see him but there was a different actor. Second point, the musical show had to begin at 7:30 PM but we have waited for fourty five minutes to see the show started. Third point, your advertisement told  about  ""discount available"" about the ticket's price but it wasn't . Fourth point, after the show, I wanted to visit your theatre restaurant but it was closed and no one didn't know why! Well, as you see it wasn't a ""perfect evening out!"" and I think that you could give to me some money back because I really have the impression that your advertisement is wrong. I'm waiting about your news, Yours FAITHFULLY,  [SEP]  We live in a society where the technology grows up everyday. We can find some everywhere. Then, I think it's interssant to answer the following question: How has modern technology changed my daily life? My plan will be very simple: a description in a first time and an analysis in a second time. Everyday at 7:00 a.m, I am woken up by my radio. After, when I take my breakfast, I use my toaster for my bread and, as I want a hot milk, I use my modern oven too. When I go to school, I can see in many stores the new tools they've just received. But I think that the most important  is my cellular phone: I can give a call or receive a call from everywhere. This little paragraph shows that I depend of technology and, more over, because I'm in an electronic eegenering school, I'm keen on technology. I don't know if it is good or bad but we are a generation who's grown up with technologies progress. Modern technology doesn't changed my daily life, it just allows  to evoluate in this new world....

263," Dear Madam or Sir I am writing this letter to complain  how terrible the show performed in your theatre was. I was interested in the advertisement about the musical show so I went to the theatre to see it two weeks ago. However, I cannot help saying that it was really  nightmare. Firstly, you advertised that Danny Brook, who is the my favorite, is a main-actor but there was another actor insted of him. Furthermore, his performance was really poor. Secondly, it started at 20:15 which was 45 minutes later than on time and there was no discount for the ticket, which is different from the advertisement. Thirdly, the only one restaurant in your theatre was closed because of renovating it. As a result, I had a totally disappointing evening during my holiday. So, I hope that you should have my money back. I will looking forward to your reply. Yours faithfully, TYUNG, SURIPHAT  [SEP]  It is certainly true that the modern technology has been changing our life a lot in these days. But how  it affect to my daily life? I get up in the morning with the soft sound of  radio program not the sound of  alarm clock and eat my breakfast watching TV news. In the bus or even in the tube, I can talk with a friend with a mobile phone when I feel boaring. Sometimes I even do some games with it. In accordance with study or work, I use a internet, which is the easist way to get informations  all around the world. Furthermore, I can write a letter to my friend who is abroad in such a short time. Without it, it would take more than one week. After comming home, I can make myself relaxed with the smooth sound of classical music from the Hi-Fi. In conclusion, modern technology affects a lot to my daily life as well as the whole society. And in my opinion the amount of it's affection to the human life would be more than this in the future. ",28.0
377," Mr. Manager, I went to the Circle Theatre to see a musical show called ""Over the Rainbow"", and I was very disappointed after it. First off all I would like to say that it has started later than it should to, I had to wait for about fourty-five minutes. Then I realized that Danny Brook did not appear in the show which was very disappoiting for me because I like this actor very much, and I think that I was not the only one who was upset. Another disappointing thing was that that discounts were not available, which made me a bit angry. Why did you write that they were available? I think that the most disappointing think was that  theatre's restaurant was closed. I would to add that I was hungry after the show.  It was not such a perfect evening out. I would rather say that it was a very disappointing evening, and I would like to have my money back as soon as possible or we will meet at court! Yours sincerlly,  [SEP]  First off all I would like to say that modern technology has changed my daily life very much. Every day when I get up I am checking if there are any messages left for me like e-mail or SMS in my mobile phone. They are very usefull things which sometimes are nessecary to survive. Modern technology has got a big influence on our life. It is easier. We can communicate with people by using mobile phones or telephones which are the best things ever made. I use them very often in my daily life. I THINK THAT TELEVISION HAS the biggest influence on our daily life. I watch about four hourers  TV a day, I even eat my meals in front of the TV. We can see PEOPLE'S LIFE in other countries which is very interesting for me and my friends. Also  Iternet has  influence on my daily life, beause I can find there many interesting things, or I can meet with people from all over the world which is exciting for me. I think that life with out modern technology would be simple and borring that's why I am using it in my daily life, I am happy that there is such  thing as modern technology. ",26.0
610," 13. June. 00 Dear Mrs Ryan, I have been the happiest woman since I have got your letter. I could not believe my eyes. This was the first competition which I took part  and I have won the first prize. It is incredible! I would like to give you some information. First of all, I would like to travel on  19th of July and come back on  2nd of August, because I have to work until 19th of July. Secondly, I would prefer to stay at Camp California, because I have been at log cabins before and I didn't enjoy it. This time I want to try something different. I would also like to tell you about my free-time activities. I like painting and climbing. I am actually not so good at climbing, but I like the fear of risks and dangers. My painting is not bad, but many people don't like the way I paint, because I use only  pencil. I am happy`,, because I will have the chance to do this two activities. Finally, I would like to ask you if I should take a lot of clothes with me, because I do not know what's the weather like there. My last question were; how much money do I need? I hope, I have answered all  questions.  I am looking forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjeyable. If I had the possibility, I would never go shopping to the big supermarkets. You can lose your way if you do not follow the signs, or you can not find the items what you want to buy. When I was at  supermarket last week I suddenly decided not buying from a supermarket at all. First of all you need a lot of time, because the market is so big. Secondly, you have a lot of choises and you do not know which one to buy. Lastly, there is a recyling problem which many people do not care about. You buy a lot of items without thinking where should go so much rubbish. For instance, I think a lot about this issue, and sometimes I do not even want to spend water, although I should do it. I think I am too sensible. I'd prefer to go  the markets which are open and outside. So you can ask about the qualities and prices and get immediately your answers. In my opinion, small  and the markets outsides should be supported, on the other hand the big supermarkets should think more about the recyling problem, which will be the most important problem in the near future.

586," Dear Helen Ryan, Thank you for the information, that I won the competition. I'll try to answer your questions. I would preffer travelling in July, I have only these time, because my summer holidays  during these days. To your answer  about living in tents or cabins, I would like to sleep in a tent. A cabin remember me too much to my home and is too confortable, that isn't what I want to have if I live in a wild area. My favourite sports are climbing and surfing, I'm very good at climbing but for surfing I need some practise. Yes, I have some questions on clothes, what should I take with me and how much money will I need? I hope, I was able to answer your questions and you will perhaps soon give me a reply on my ones. Yours, Vadim Titov  [SEP]  Dear Kim, You can't believe what I did last month. I was given the opportunity to build up the concert and of course I took my chance. First I arrived really early in the morning on the place, but the people were just working and I joined them. My duty was to montage the spot lights on the right places, but it wasn't just easy. You had always some problems because like not having enough wire or the lamps were broken by the transport. The experience that I made was, that I had never worked in a such perfect team. I was able to ask anybody, and he answered detailly, althoug he was full of work. After the hard work we took cool drinks, sat down on the ground and enjoyed the pop concert. And as the pop stars thanked us for our hard job we all were a little proud to be here. Love, Vadim ",27.0
1074," Dear Mr Robertson, I am writing to your about the trip in London. Thanks for your programme, we are all looking forwards especially for the Monday 13 March because we will discover all the monument in London. However, we have got a suggestion: we saw an advertissement for ""the London Fashion and Leisure Show"" which is going to be on Tuesday March 14 from 10:00 to 19:00. For all of us, it sound like a great opportunity because we though that this event would makes us learn about the way of life in London,  the english style.... Moreover, the big advantage is that it is a free show so you will not have to worry about the budget. Our request is to change the programme, either you can cancel all the Tuesday and we can enjoy all the exhibition or if you cannot cancel the Museum, we can go there right after because we will have full of time to  shopping during our free time on Wednesday.  Hoping that you will think about it carefully because we are all very exciting. thanks in advance Yours Faithfully  [SEP]  Since always, medias has been keen of famous people life and it's becoming worst and worst, you can find everything in ""gossip"" Newspapers. Does famous people deserve to keep their own life secret? According to me, you can't deserve to have a private life when you're famous because when  to start you career you know that  medias will be hunting you everywhere and  more famous you get  worst it is going to be because that  the life style people wants to know everything , for instance, about their favourite actor or about their president.. they saw them many time on T.V. or   Cinema, So people wonder about them. And famous people like it because if you're a star or whatever it's because you like to show yourself. therefore, even if I agree sometimes  Medias are going too far and write really bad things. if you're famous you cannot have  private life because all of this is a part of their job. And if  Medias are too awful they have got  law to protect themself. ",28.00
686," Dear Mr. Ryan Thank you for your letter. I have just received the letter from you. I am really pleased that I have won first prize in your competition at Camp California in  U.S.A. I would like to travel in July this year because I think the weather will be nice and I can take a holiday. I would like to use a tent for my accommodation. I think it is more interesting than  log cabins. I can be more next  nuture and I have never used tents before. It seems to be exciting. I choose swimming and painting for my activities while I am at the Camp. I really like swimming. When I was a child, I used to go swimming with my family at the weekend having a chat, making a barbecue, playing games. It was such a good time. I enjoy painting as well. My mother told me that I'm good at painting. When I was in high school, I won second prize in a painting competition. My parents were very pround of me. Could I ask you some questions? I would like to know which kind of clothes I should bring to the camp. How much money should I bring there and can I use my credit card at the camp? I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Kim, Thank you for your letter. I'm sorry that I've taken such a long time to reply  your letter because I'm really busy and I have to study harder. I'm taking the final exam next month. Lucky me! I've got some great news to tell you. Last month, I worked as a part-time job. I really enjoyed helping at a pop concert. As you know, I'm crazy about pop music. Before the concert I was really exciting. I couldn't sleep well and I didn't know what I had to do in the concert. It was such a big concert. There were lots of singers and  band. Of course, there were lots of spectaculars. First, I was in front of the entrance door. I had to check tickets. I was really exciting. My hands were sclumbling but I did it very well. After that, I went to the back stage. I could see lots of pop stars. I'm sorry that I didn't ask them to take any pictures for you. I was really busy. I had to take care of them and did everything they want. For instance, taking them to  toilet, making coffee for them, helping them find their stuff. It was really busy but I really enjoyed it. I learnt lots of thing from here that I couldn't learn from school. I had to be more patient. I knew lots of people from different job. It was a great time. I'd better close now. I've got lots of homework to do. Take care of yourself and I look forward to hearing from you. Best wishes, ",28.0
447," Dear Sir/Madam, I'm writing  you followwing our visitting  your theatre last night. As I saw from your advertisement in the newspaper, it said 'Starring: Danny Brook and Tina Truelove'. I was disappointed when I found the actor wasn't Danny Brook! And from your advertisement, the show should start at 19.30 but it didn't. It was 45 minutes late! And also I couldn't buy tickets with my credit card but on the advertisement, it said 'discounts available' I was really annoyed by that! After the show, we expacted to eat something in your restaurant, but it  closed! I have no idea why! We had a really unenjoyable time at your theatre. And I would like to know if it  posible to have the money back. Thank you very much and I look forward to hear from you. Yours centainly, Porawek Phowrung.  [SEP]  Unfortunately Pat wasn't good at keeping secrets. So one week later all  student in my class knew that I was an angle. Certainly! Nobody believed her... neither me. But it's true... I'm an angle and I wanted to visit the earth. It's easy to do but the only one rule was I can tell my secret to only one person. And if someone elso knows, I won't be able to go back to the heaven unless I kill the person who told my secret. Pat was the only person who I told my secret  but now it has become a joke! I promised to myself... I would have to kill her! I started my plan. I went to Pat's house but her brother told me that she wasn't there. I offered to wait... Her brother and I began to talk... He's such a nice boy. I liked him very much and I guessed he liked me too... We started to go out in the same time as I started to change my mind.

455," Dear Sir, I've been recently to one of yours musical shows called ""Over the rainbow"" in the Circle theatre in London thinking it might be a good idea but it was desappointing. I'm writting this letter to explain  you what had happened and look for a solution. To begin, the organitzation of your collegues of the theatre was awful becouse of diferents problems. Despite saying it will start at 19:30, it done at 20:15 which I think is to much late for a good theatre like yours. After, you say in the advertisement  to visit your restaurant, however it was close, how can you explain that? Secondly, there were some false information in your advertisement that made me angry. You say it would be Danny brook the man who was going to sing but it wasn't. And to sum up, there weren't  discounts on the prices of the tickets. For all of that, I want my money back, at least 15 of the 20 pounds I'd paid. Looking for forward  hearing from you. Your faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, so without want I knew that it was going to be a concert on owr city  of, from my point of view, the best group of the world, Oasis. And she had planned with my friends went there without me. At first I got angry with Pat more than with the others friends of the group, becouse Pat was and is my best friend. However, a couple of minutes later, I calmed down and asked she why. She answered to me becouse all this year I have been so irritated that I got angry with every person who tried to talk to me, and the others friend had convinced her to let me out. The I realised that she got reason, I was irritated becouse my parent was going to  divorce, but Pat would always be my best friend so I told her that I wasn't angry with her and I was not going to go to the concert becouse I had to go to the court to solve my parent's affair. I asked her to look photos of Oasis for me and she accepted. If Pat had been good at keeping secrets, I wouldn't have known anything about the concert and I wouldn't have got angry for not being able to go. And that's the history of how I lose the oportunity to go to the only concert that Oasis had done in my city. ",20.0
311," Dear Sirs We are writting to you to complain about the musical show ""Over the Rainbow"",  we saw last week in your Theatre. We have spent a week's holiday in London and wanted to see a musical show. We read an advertisement about your musical show, starred by the well-known Danny Brook and Tina Truelove in a local newspaper We were very disappointed to hear that the actor was replaced by other  at the last minute. The advertisement said that it starts at 19.30, but it started actually at 20:15 due to the probleme of the sound. We were also surprised to discover that the student discounts wasn't available for us, because they didn't accept our student indentity card from Switzerland. We were very frustrated to read on the door of the theatre restaurant ""Close due to holidays"" specially when we were very starving. This evening was a waste of time. So we asked you for our money back. I  looking forward to hearing from you soon. Yours Sincerely  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed your daily life? Could you figure out how your life will be without all the modern technology? What is the effect of it  in your environement? Were the people happier in a past than to day? If you are interested in the question, you will be interested by this article. Nowadays, the technology takes  a large place in your daily life and improves the speed of the achievement. For example at work, we look on the computer screen all day, sending e-mail at the other side of the world, doing some searches etc. We gain a lot of time with  computer, but if your computer brooks down, you couldn't do anything because everything is on it. The technology moves very fast specially in the domaine of transportation. The cars are able to reach 300 km per hours speed and are more reliable than in the past. The major probleme for the industry cities is to deal with the bad effect of polution in the environement. A lot of money are involved in research to stop the increasing   of polution. To sum up, all the improvements have a price to pay; The condition of the environement. We are too reliable at technology today. But we can ask us ""What will be happen in 50 years? Our children will be able to travel in the moon as we travel to Japan? ",24.0
304," Dear sir or madam, My name is Molly Menbrook. I have seen your new musical, 'Over the rainbow'. I am sorry but I must admit it was a bit disappointing. I bought the ticket for the evening performance to end the day with a nice musical. But the time wasn't kept. I had to wait 45mins to get in! So in order to keep myself occupied for a while, I went to the restaurant except it wasn't open. I couldn't see anyone inside either. No one. The show it self was quite disappointing. The show was OK though I suggest you hire different actors. I think Danny Brook doesn't suit the role he plays in this musical... Also you mentioned a discount. For tickets. Well no, I didn't get a discount! And the tickets were pretty expensive... Anyway, after watching the musical, I felt a bit peckish so I went to the restaurant again with  hope that it might be open, but still, nobody was in. Then a person appeared, walking towards the door to the kitchen, I guessed. I asked him why the restaurant was closed. He said it was because the runner of the restaurant had gone out to arrange the food supply for the next day. They had been closed for 3 days according to him. So you see my point. It wasn't very pleasant. So I am going to ask for a refund... I hope this isn't affending you too much... Or asking you for too much. Reply as soon as possible, best regards,  [SEP]  I think the clothes in future will be similar in shape as the clothes that exist now. Just like sweaters, shoes, t-shirts etc... But maybe not. When it comes down to color, I think it'll be much brighter and maybe glittery. Like shiny and plastic kind. Maybe silver and gold, glittery red, purple and blue. As well as bright yellow, orange and green. All suitable for discos! Shoes will be high heeled and modern. Colors to match the clothes. Still, comfortable. I think they'll be based on some kind of space theme and aliens. But I think I prefer the clothes now. I'll stick to baggy t-shirts, jeans, baseball caps and trainers. They'll do for me instead of all the silvers and golds. Al the spacy theme. I think I'll be fine in the clothes we have now... I mean, I won't get sick in them! Though some people may fancy the glitter and the spacy feel, I don't like it and I hope it really isn't the style for the future. It's just not my cup of tea... ",30.0

404," To Manager. My name is Sam. I would like to inform you that your advertisement mentions so many different things, so it spoilt a part of my journey. Then I want to receive my money for the ticket. After reading your advertisement. I went to your theatre to see 'Over the rainbow' last night. I was excited to see it. But everything was terrible and different from your advertisement. First of all the actor was different. So I was disappointed. I had wanted to see Danny Brook in the show. The movie started 20.15 not 19.30. You wrote 'discouts available' but they didn't  discount. After the show, I couldn't have my dinner in your theatre restaurant. The restaurant was closed because of being repaired. You advertised for my perfect evening out. But I was unpleasent because of these things. So I ask you to return some money back. If you have something to ask, please call me. I will stay until the end of this month. The number is 577-6277. (Hotel number). I wait to hear from you soon.  [SEP]  I think there is nothing not to be influenced by science and technology affects in our daily life nowadays. I would like to answer how modern technology has changed my daily life as a housewife. I have much housework to be done from early morning until late evening. I always use many electric products; washing machine, dish-washer, vacuum cleaner, blender, juice, fridge. I think I can have my spare time owing to these thing. For example if I don't have  washing machine, I will have to wash all  clothes myself. Then it takes about 1 hour or one and a half to wash. During the washing machine is whirring, I can get my time. So I can read my book or do another thing. Also I can't imagine my life without  car. It would be terrible. Now I can't live without them. Owing to all of them, I can live very comfortbly. These things provide me  all convenience. ",26.0
573," Dear Ryan, I have received your letter and I  so happy because I have won the holiday in California. It will be a pleasure for me give you the information that you need. First of all I would like to travel in July because I am going to Ibiza with my parents in June and in August I start to work part-time, so I am afraid but I can go only in July. With reference to the accommodation I would prefer  log cabins to  tents. I think the log cabins are more comfortable and I have never slept in a tents. I am very good at playing basketball. When I was a child I used to play daily with my classmates and now I am playing at least at the weekend. I have taken a Photography course and I enjoy taking photos to animals. I would like to know, how much  I need and what type of clothes I should take? Could you tell me about the weather, please? I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I hope you are very well. I am writing about my exciting experience at a pop concert. First of all I was too busy but it does not matter because I enjoyed a lot of this experience. I was doing different activities from designering flier to selling tickets. I had to search in the internet  pictures that could be used for the flier. We booked the accommodation for the group. I was responsible for checking the light and sound. In addition I checked the e-mail dialy and answered the phone. As you know I sold tickets in some schools and pubs, too. Anyway, it has been one of the most wonderful experience in my life, but the concert day was really amazing. I think this was the best of all. I feel really happy that I participated in this event. If you have the opportunity of involving in something like this you do not hesitate. Yours sincerely ",32.0
358," Manager Date 17-06-00 xxxx Dear Sir, I'm writing to complain about the performance,  Over The Rainbow at The Circle Theatre on the 14th of June. It is always a great opportunity to enjoy a musical when you go on your holiday to London. London is one of Europe's biggest centre and you can always get the best in show business . Rescently I decided to watch Over The Rainbow, a very famous and wellknown show. Firstly, the night performance was 45 minutes late and there were no discounts available as the advertisement told. Furthermore, I was shooked when one of the main persons entered the stage. He wasn't Danny Brook, one of the resons for my choice . Finally, the Theatre Restaurant was under reparation so we had to find another one for the evening supper. This wasn't ""my perfect evening out"", as said, and I'll make a claim for half the money back. I'm looking forward to receiving you reply as soon as possibly. Yours faithfully, Kim Nissen  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed my daily life. A century ago, when a farmer took the horses out of the stable and put the plouge behind them, we've got the word ""time"". Why not talk about the social life just sitting around a table without no rush. In modern days we have to wear a mobile phone. I visited an airport some days ago and in nearly every crowded corner, I could see those busy people  always on their way . I heard the different phone signals, and what a miracle you can change them on the train when you are restless. A new word has appeared in those days, a technical proof of this is the computer. I can send and save information and the possibilities are uncountless. In nearly every home you can find it and the users now and in the future are the new generation. I must say a few words about the new electrical cars which surely will have a central role , exspecially today when fuel is so expensive. Watch out highly advanced technologies are appropriate and helpful for me and others if we only remember the importance of  time to be together. ",23.0
763," Dear Sir & Madam Thank you for your letter. I'm writing this letter to tell you some further information that you need. First of all, I'd like to travel in July because I have to work  except that month. July is the only month that I can be free. I prefer staying in tents because it is  unusual experience for me. Also I'd like to have the chance to play tennis and  sailing at the camp. Talking about tennis, I used to play it for about five years when I was a child. I think I'm much better than a beginner. But I never had a chance to enjoy sailing. I'd like to try this time. Now, I have two questions about camping. First, what clothes should I bring? Is it hot enough? I've never been to California, therefore please let me know about the weather there. Second, how much money to I need? I haven't a clue about it. I'd like to know some examples. I'm waiting for your reply. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Kim It was so nice to hear from you last time. Thank you very much. As I mentioned before, I really enjoyed helping at a pop concert last month, the artist's name was ""Bonny Pink"" who is famous in my country. I could enjoy her music very much. My job was looking after her when she had a break time. I guided her to a rest room and served her a cup of tea, and so on. I thought it was  most exciting job. Actually, I could have a chance to ask her about music, her favorite artist and her hobby. I was impressed when I heard that she liked playing puzzle alone. She seemed to be  very active woman when she was singing but at the same time she had  very gentle attitude when she spoke to me. I became a fan of her. It was  very interesting experience for me. I wish you were there. But don't worry Kim, I'll send you a copy of her CD for you. I hope you can enjoy . Anyway it's the time to go to bed. Take care of yourself, Kim. I'm waiting for your letter.

702," Dear Mrs Ryan, I have just received your letter and feel happy about winning first prize. I am now writing to give you all  information you require. First of all, I would like to travel only in July because I am employed and will be able to finish my contract in June. On August I am going to apply for a new job. Also, I would prefer to stay in a log cabin rather than stay in a tent. From my point of view, log cabins are more comfortable. Another consideration are  activities.

194," DEAR SIR, I AM WRITTING IN ORDER TO COMPLAINT ABOUT THE SHOW THAT YOUR THEATRE OFFER. I WENT TO YOUR THEATRE WITH THE IDEA OF HAVING A GREAT TIME, UNFORTUNETELY, THINGS WERE VERY WRONG. FIRSTLY, IN THE ADVERTISEMENT FOR THE SHOW IT SAID THAT THE STAR WAS DANNY BROOK, AND THAT WAS FALSE BECAUSE THERE WAS A DIFFERENT ACTOR. THIS WAS VERY DISAPPOINTING. SECONDLY, THE SHOW WAS SUPPOSED TO START AT HALF PAST SEVEN IN THE AFTERNOON, BUT IT STARTED AT QUARTER PAST EIGH, THAT IS FOURTY-FIVE MINUTES LATER! IT IS ALSO ADVERTISED THAT THERE WERE DISCOUNTS AVAILABLE, HOWEVER, THAT WAS ANOTHER LIE. LASTLY, AFTER THAT AWFULL EXPERIENCE I TRIED TO VISIT YOUR THEATRE RESTAURANT, OF COURSE, I COULDN'T DO IT BECAUSE IT WAS CLOSE. AS YOU CAN SEE, THAT WASN'T MY PERFECT EVENING OUT (AS YOU PROMISE IN THE ADVERTISEMENT), SO I WANT YOU TO GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK. YOURS FAITHFULLY INGO SANOU  [SEP]  UNFORTUNETELY, PAT WASN'T VERY GOOD AT KEEPING SECRETS AND I DISCOVERED IT TOO LATE. IF I HAD KNOWN THAT BEFORE, I WOULDN'T TOLD HER THAT I HAD DISSAPROVE MY MATHEMATICS EXAM. LAST WEEK I HAD AN ARGUE WITH MY MOTHER. SHE TOLD ME THAT I WAS SPENDING TOO MUCH TIME WITH MY FRIENDS, SO MY QUALIFICATIONS WERE GOING TO BE VERY BAD. I SAID THAT I KNEW WHAT I WAS DOING AND THAT MY MARKS WOULD BE GOOD. AFTER THAT PAT INVITED ME TO GO TO THE CONCERT OF CHARLY GARCIA. THE CONCERT WAS PLANNED FOR THE FOLLOWIN FRIDAY, WICH WAS THE DAY AFTER MY TEACHER GAVE ME MY MARKS. I REALLY WANTED TO GO, AND I KNEW THAT MY EXAM WAS NO GOOD, SO I TOLD MY MOTHER THAT I WOULD GET MY QUALIFICATIONS THE NEXT MONDAY, SO MY MOTHER ALLOWED ME TO GO. THAT FRIDAY, I KNEW THAT I HAD DISSAPROVED THE EXAM, AND PAT KNEW IT TOO. OF COURSE, I DIDN'T THINK ABOUT TELLING THAT TO MY MOTHER, BUT PAT CAME TO MY HOUSE AND TOLD IT TO MY MOTHER, WITHOUT ANY INTENTION . AS A RESULT, I WASN'T ALLOWED TO GO TO THE CONCERT, BUT PAT TOLD ME THAT IT WAS GREAT. ",28.0
1171," To: Mrs. Smith Thank you for your letter, which arrived on  second. June. I am very pleased to help to organize this Conference in our College, which will hold at  Conference Centre at Bromley College starting on 20th June for 3 days. please find  information your required as follows: We have booked the hotel for the group. Called ""palace Hotel"" which is about 10 miles away from our College, the hotel will have a coach to pick the group up from the airport on  19th of June and then take the group to  Conference and return to  hotel every day. Regarding to the end-of-conference party. We have planed a barbecue at 5 oo pm. on our most idyllic play field which is over looking the endless Countryside and farms. At 7:00pm. we can move to our student hall to have a disc dance until 10:00pm. On the last day, we have arranged a small party in the hotel, then we all set up to have a sightseeing  Bromley town center for about two hours before you leave for  airport. Bromley town center is the most beautiful shopping centre in South East London. There are many historical buildings remain. I think the students will enjoy this sightseeing . If any further discussion, please let me know. Yours. sincerely,  [SEP]  How wonderful ""light"" We need light every day, not just  night time. We need lamp light in offices or schools or some places during the day time. How is the wonderful life after  invention the  light. Here we just talk about the light we invented apart from nature light. When I was small, we lived in country yard, I remembered, we used to have oil lamps which used a cotton string dipping in the oil in the small bottle and made it burned the tip of the cotton string to give us light during the night time, it was very little light on, and  many things we couldn't do under the  oil lamps because the light range was very small. There was no any light outside our house,  no light on the road or field either. I was always very scared whenever or wherever . because most places. Covered by dark, dark and dark. This scaring dark is still affecting my life now. I never stayed out after dark today except accompanying by my family. What a biggest person on the earth, who invented the light, Einstein was. He created another day time after sunset, people use it to do anything they want to do, We believe we can't live without light today, specially in  city life, we have a long time to spend for the activities after  Sun going to bed. Which we definately need light to keep on. I dare to say, without light, our life will go into a dark, dark hell. ",29.00
152," Dear Sir/Madam. I'm writing to complain about the theatre show you did last week because there were too many irregularities during the show. Firstly, the guests stars who were supposed to play were different  and very disappointing because they stopped the show twice. Secondly, the show started 45 minutes late when it was supposed to start at 19:30 and anyone explained to us, the public, what was happening. To make matters worse when we bought the tickets, they were too much expensive and there weren't any discounts for young people or for groups. But the worst happened when the show finished, because we (my girlfriend and I) were hungry and the theatre restaurant was closed. Maybe, this was the worst show I have ever seen and for this  I'll wait for the refund. Your's Faithfully.  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets so we couldn't explain her what happened that night. Jon had crashed with Pat's boyfriend car and he told her that someone had kicked the car with a metal stick. Pat's boyfriend couldn't believe that story but Pat trusted in Jon and she thinked that he was honest. However, Jon felt very disappointed and he told the truth. At the beggining they didn't talk to each other but yesterday they both took part in a radio programme and she forgave him. Now Pat is angry with us because we didn't explain her what happened that night, and because she has left her boyfriend. It could be worse than it was and for this we are happy, but now we can't hide anything to her. ",24.0

You can find futher information from me about Camp California in the USA. First of all I should go to Camp California only  July because I will start working in our local leisure centre as a swimming instructer  And I would like to  swimming  activities at the camp. My second chose is painting because I love water colour painting and I am a member of the our water colour painting club in my town. I would like to stay in  log cabins because I have bad experiens about tents. I do not like to stay in such a small place. Lastly, I would like to know how much money I should bring with me and could you give me  clue about what I must bring as a clothes and what I do not need it. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Shopping is Not Enjoy Anymore We are all costemers of the big supermarkets They have all what we need it. They are a bit far from town but they have huge car park. They give us lots of chose to buy what we need it and what we can try for. Also they give lots of sale for everything even you can join their club for extra discount. It look wonderful does not it. But when we thing   properly shopping is not enjoyable for example if you forget something that  need for  salat. You have to go back  this supermarket and find  nearest parking space then before someone takes the their last fresh lemon for your salat you must find  where was the lemon section before because they love change the store  again and again. When you get your lemon you have to go to queue to lemons money. At it shows shopping is become  our dislikes, because of the huge supermarkets. ",23.0
300," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to you because of the unpleasent evening I have spent recently. I have always thought that  plays of the Circle Theatre are worth of seeing, but two days before I was very disappointed after visiting yours theatre. Ealyer I had seen an advertisement for the show but the informationes on it caused fals. First of all I have not seen my favourite actor Danny Brook. The second think is that the play did not start at 19:30 but at 20:15! I could not get a discount. The last think is that it was unpossible to get  the theatre restaurant because it was closed. I was told that it had been painted but nobody had written it on an advertisement. At the end I would like to say that my evening out two days before was not perfect and I wold be glad if you could pay my some money back. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Modern technology is changing  world every day. I would like to write  how it has influented my daily life. I am a student of a technical univercity. Some time before I did not know  the internet. When I neaded some informationes I had to go to  liblary to find it in books or newspapers. Now the only think I have to do is to go to  computer room and turn on the computer. The computer is helpfull when I want to contact somebody very fast. I just send an e-mail and that is all! The second think is that when I neaded a phone card to call somebody I had to stay in a long queue. Now I just only put some money into a machine and I can take the card from there! The last example is that I have in my house a lot of modern equipment like  TV set, fridge or microwaves which help me for my living. It is obvious that modern technology has changed my daily life.

1241," Dear Mrs Smith, I'm writing in response to the letter we have received from you, in order to let you know all the information you have asked for. First of all, your group has been booked into the Palace Hotel, Main-Road 21, which is situated not far from our college. I'd suggest you to walk, it will only take you about seven minutes. Just follow Main-Road until  to reach a junction, where you turn right and then walk along Denl-a-Lion Road. The college is a huge, yellow building - you can't miss it. Secondly, you have required information about the end-of-conference party. It will begin at 6 o'clock p.m. and last until midnight. All the students will be provided with sacks and we have managed to book a band as well. The location of the party isn't fixed yet, but we will let you know after your arrival. There is no need putting on special clothes for the party, casual ones should do it as well, for we want everyone to feel comfortable. Last but not least I will give you some ideas of where to spend your free afternoon. I'd suggest you to visit our local museum, as there is a marvellous exhibition there at the moment. Provided the weather is fine, you could also go swimming or make a tour through our beautiful town. (I could book a guide for you if you're interested) Please write back or call me if there is any more information you need. I'm looking forward to meeting you and wish you all the best. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  The telephone, a blessing. Who of you could imagine life without the telephone? Not being able to call your friend and ask if you can pop in for a moment? Not being able to lie to your mother-in-law and pretend you can't attend her garden party because of an illness, without having to look her in the eye? When Alexander Graham Bell first invented the telephone, he had no idea of how popular it would be one day. Its first appliance was in order to listen to a concert if you were not able to attend it in person. Nowadays, however, the whole world is connected by a telephone system and no one could imagine life without it. Take me, for example, I use it whenever there is a problem and I need some advice, or when I have to call off a meeting for any reason. I cannot always walk to the person and say ""Sorry, I must cancel our meeting"", because then it's too late anyway, isn't it? Life definitely wouldn't be the same without the invention of the telephone. We use it daily in order to get information or to pass it on. Just try to spend one week without using a telephone at all, and you will see that it is impossible to do so. So don't take the telephone for granted, but keep in mind that our modern way of life is mainly due to its invention. ",40.00

This would be an ideal opportunity for me to visit the United States to learn  the American way of life. First of all, I would like to travel on July because I have a lot of work in my company at the moment, so my boss said I can have my travel-holiday only on July. Secondly, I'd like to prefer to stay in tents, that would be the first chance for me to sleep on the outskirts of California. It could be very enjoyable. And I would like to choose  my activities Golf and painting. I used to play Golf several years  and I like to paint the composition. Last, I have no experience in  abroad. Therefore I'd like to know about the weather in California on July. Which clothes should I take? May be there are some occasions which I have to pay  myself. As above mentioned, please take care to give me more information, and if you'd like to know more, please telephone me for further discussion. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely, Yuna ARNISTON  [SEP]  Seoul is the capital city of Korea. It is a largish city and has a population of over eight million. I went to school there for twelve years.

There are also many kinds of take-away restaurants, where I can taste my favorite foods. That doesn't cost much.

499," Dear Sir, I believe that you must be the manager and I would like to point some complaints of mine about the play ""Over the Rainbow""  Firstly, in the advertisement you said that Dany Brook was going to be starring in the play, but you've placed another actor in his place, which was very disappointing. Moreover, the theatre's play was expected to start at half past seven in the afternoon, however it started at quarter past eight! We had to wait all that time without someone to explain  us the reason for this delay. To make matters worse, your theatre restaurant was closed and one of your assistants said that it was being under construction for the expansion of that place. This so-called ""Perfect Evening"" was so disappointing as well as discouraging  of coming to your Circle Theatre again. After all I've been through, I would like a refund of my money. Thank you for your interest. Sincerely yours,   [SEP]  Nowadays, the technology has expanded its ""legs"" to almost every part of our interests, jobs and even hobbies. Therefore, our life has changed a lot since a hundred years ago, as well as mine did. The biggest achievement of modern technology has broken into my house as soon as I was at the age of ten. This achievement is the personal computer, which has grown very fast, because of the help it can provide. My computer helps me in my studies, homeworks and projects for school. With the Internet, I got more socialised using the Relay Chat clients, but also got a kind of boredom, which is known as ""Internet Freak Disease""! I use it a lot so sometimes I feel pain in my eyes or my hands. Moreover, fishing was affected by the modern technology. Fishing is my hobby and that's why I bought these plastic worms and fish, that are not so good - it's better to use alive worms! To sum up, my life is surrounded by modern gadgets. Sometimes these gadgets are for the best and - more often - for the worst!! It only depends of your judgement and the way you're about to use technology. ",23.0

When we arrived at the Circle theatre in the evening, we were waiting during a long time, because that you advertisement noticed that the musical show would begin at 19:30, and eventually it began at 20:15. Moreover, the actors were not the same of  the advertisement. Finally, after the show we went to the theatre restaurant but it was closed because they were on holidays. This evening was the worst evening of all my life. I would like that you give me back some money of the tickets. I look  to hearing from you soon. Yours faithfully.

FIRST OF ALL, DIFFERENTLY OF ADVERTISED, THE MAIN ACTOR WAS NOT DANNY BROOK, BUT OTHER UNKNOWN PERSON. TO MAKE MATTER WORSE, THE SHOW DELAYED STARTING AT 20:15. AS IF THIS WERE NOT ENOUGH, I DID NOT OBTAIN A DISCOUNT IN THE PRICE OF THE TICKET, ALTHOUGH THIS WAS POSSIBLE ACCORDING TO YOUR LEAFLET. ON TOP OF EVERYTHING, I COULD NOT VISIT THE RESTAURANT OF THIS PLACE, BECAUSE IT WAS CLOSED AFTER THE SHOW. I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED, BECAUSE THAT EVENING OUT WAS NOT  PERFECT AS I HAD PLANNED.

AS A RESULT OF THIS PEOPLE'S DAILY LIFE HAS BEEN CHANGING AS WELL. AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT, IT'S WORTH TO POINTING OUT THE FOLLOWING: FIRST AND FOREMOST, IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT TODAY IT IS EASIER TO TRAVEL AROUND THE WORLD BECAUSE NOWADAYS THERE ARE LOTS OF GOOD AND FAST WAYS OF TRANSPORT. IN THE SAME WAY, WE CAN TRAVEL INSIDE OUR COUNTRY QUICKLY AND SAFELY. CONSEQUENTLY, WE'VE GOT FACILITIES TO KNOW MANY DIFFERENT PLACES AND TO CONTACT DIFFERENT PEOPLE, TOO. SECONDLY, WE CAN'T FORGET EITHER THAT ALL OF US HAVE  CONDITIONS TO COMMUNICATE WITH PEOPLE BY MOBILE PHONES, BY  INTERNET, WHO LIVE NOT ONLY IN THIS COUNTRY, BUT ALSO ABROAD. FINALLY, WE CAN CONSIDER, TOO, THAT THE TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN PROVIDING US WITH IMPORTANT DISCOVERIES, MAINLY IN MATTERS ABOUT HEALTH,  ENVIRONMENT AND SO ON. IN CONCLUSION, I REALLY BELIEVE THAT OUR DAILY LIFE IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN IT WAS IN THE LAST CENTURY AND EVEN IN THE BEGGINING OF THIS CENTURY.

1078," Dear Mr. Robertson, My name is Bao-yu Liao. I am  representative of our class in your college to write to you. We are very grateful for what you have well-organised the programme going to London for us. It is a good programme, especially  National Art Gallery is one of the most places we would like to visit. This is because we are very interested in art. In fact, some of our classmates have seen an advertisement for the 'London Fashion and Leisure Show'. Concidently the show is in London and on Tuesday March 14 which is during the period we are in London for the three-day programme. We think it is a great opportunity because we are very interested in art and fashion. Of course,  leisure as well. Therefore, if it is possible, we would like to see the show in the afternoon on 14 March instead of going shopping. It would be very much appreciated if you could arrange  the programme to be changed. We look forward to hearing a good news from you soon. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Famous people, such as politicians and film stars, deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time. We know it does not matter  they are famous or not, everyone has his own privacy. However, as human beings, almost all of us are curious. We like to know and chat about gossip. This is why gossip magazines are so popular. Due to commercial value, journalists have to follow them all the time to peep  their private lives to satisfy us. There, it is impossible for journalists to stop chasing them. However, journalists should not only think about commercial value, but morality and priciples are also being concerned. Of course, it everyone pays less attention or interest, the situations should be better. I remember in August 1997 Princess Diana died in the car crash was one of the most disarster examples. Although we can not deny it is our nature -  curious, we can improve our sence of morality and try to think about the importance of privacy for them. Actually, I am happy to hear that journalists have learned their lesson from the death of Princess Diana and try to let her children and  Royal family have more privacy. Lets all leave them more freedom to enjoy their private lives. ",31.00
1080," Dear Mr Robertson, First of all, I am writing to thank you for organising  school's trip to London. The programme seems to be really interesting, especially visiting the Science Museum. However, the students in my class have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show, which is going to take place on  14th of March at  Central Exhibition Hall. Visitors will be able to see the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear and also get some help with make up or hairstyle. It would be  great opportunity to see this show, because we are all very interested in  fashion subject. What is more, admittion for students is free. Do you think that it would be possible to change the programme of our trip? In our opinion we could join the show on Tuesday, after visiting the Science Museum. It would not be a problem to go shopping on Wednesday in our free time. I look forward to hearing from you. Your sincerely,  [SEP]  Famous people, such as politicians and film stars, deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time. In these days, when we can see  picture of  famous person almost on every first page of the newspaper, it's a quite common topic . First of all, I think that famous people deserve to have  private life. Journalists should not follow them all the time, trying to make an interview or taking an 'interesting' picture. Secondly, I can really understand how annoying or depressing it can be. I think that deep inside famous persons are just ordinary people and like for all of us having a private life is important for  psychological condition. On the other hand, we could say that they decided to have such kind of life. Maybe they need to pay the price for being rich and popular? Maybe sometimes they need to sacrifice their privacy? In conclusion, I think that it is very hard to find an answer to this question. However, everyone needs to have some part of his life being a secret. ",33.00
880," Dear Helen, I was very glad to receive this great notice. I am very excited about it. I entered in this competition because I have always wanted to do these kind of things. In your letter you asked me when I would rather travel, I will be able  only on July because I have to work and I can take some days off on this month. If it is no problem I would rather stay in a lab cabin because I do not like much sleeping on the floor, but if you can not put me there I will be fine anywhere. About the  I have to choose I would like to tell you something. I am very good at tennis and photography but I would prefer to practice new ones, if it is possible. I am keen on water and risk sports so I would choose climbing and surfing, I think it would be great if I learn them while I am there. Finally, I would like to ask you if there is any place where I can buy some souvenirs, so to take some money with me and I would be very grateful if you could send me a list of clothes. Thank you for everything. I am looking forward to travelling. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Every woman in the world likes the word shopping. It is like if they lose their concience while they are shopping. You can do shopping alone, with friends or with your kids, but the best thing of it is that you feel that you have all the power while you are buying things. May be it is not for you, may be it is a present, but buying things at least for me it is the best. But all this power and all this excitement could turn into something that you could start to hate. When you go shopping and there are a lot of people in the same place, all trying to find the best prices and not carying about anybody, this could get crazy to anyone. The long queues, close places, hight prices, sales, all these things conbined could make shopping an enjoyable thing for people who like doing it. But my advise for people, who like it so much that  can not help doing it, is to try shopping in the afternoon, at this hour no-one do shopping and if there are some shops that are closed you can always go to a shopping mall.

931," Dear Mrs Helen Ryan, I received your letter congratulating me on having won the first prize in your competition. I am extremely excited about the opportunity to go to your camp in the USA. Firstly, I have to say that I am studying at University and I wonder if I could travel on July because of the exams I have on May. Apart from that I would not be able to travel there until the end of June. It does not matter to me whether I stay in  tent or  log cabin, but I would prefer  tent  to be much more in contact with  wild life and nature. The activities I'd like to do most are playing basketball and Climbing. The first one because I have been played basketball since the age of twelve and the second one because there are not many places where to go climbing in my city. Finally, I would  ask you if I have to take my own clothes with me or  you will provide me with some, and  the amount of money needed. I am looking forward to hearing from you soon. Yours Sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I received your letter last week in which you told me that you want to hear about my experience at the pop concert. It was terrible! We have a lot of problems from the beggining. The first one was the security. People in charge of security didn't arrive when they were supposed to. If it weren't a calm and quite public, we would have had troubles. Another problem was the band. They didn't want to play until the room were crowded. So that concert started an hour and a half latter. Everything was all right during the perform of the band, but at the end some espectators came up to the stage and made some damage to the band's instrument. The singer and the guitarist were so angry that they went out immediately leaving the public without the last part of the show. As you can see, hardly anything went well, but the lights and the sound -  both in wich I helped carrying things - were appropriate for the concert. Althought all these things, I gained a lot of experience and I could be near one of my favourite pop stars, which was the better experience I've ever had. Looking forward to hearing from you soon. Love, ",31.0
550," Dear Helen Ryan, I'm really happy to know that I won in your competition. And first of all, before  to ask for informations about the travel, I want to tell you thanks a lot. I would like to travel in July because  is the best period to take a break from my work. For the accomodation, if is possible I would like to stay in  camping because I think  is a relaxing place where to stay. Further because I like to live in contact with the nature. Also  is possible to meet a lot of people, and chatting during the night, might around the fire, playing a clutone and singing I think  is a nice way to have fun. I'm really happy to know that  is possible to play sports. I would like to play Tennis, and  swimming. I choose tennis because  is a sport that you can play with others people, also because I like the competition in the sport. The other sport that I would like to do is swimming. Swimming is my favourite sport because you can relax your body and your mind. I would like to ask you for further informations about this travel. First of all which kind of clothes  I have to bring with me? How much money  I need to do this travel? Also, if is possible I want to know if there is the possibility  to organise a trip around the most important cities near the camp? And if during the nights there are  entrotenements? Thanks for all these informations, I'm looking forward to hearing  you again. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  After the discussion that we had in the english class, I understood that a lot of people sometimes don't enjoy during the shopping. I can't understand these people because this situation never happen to me. By the way usually the people that don't like shopping are men or children. I think  is difficult to find a woman that doesn't like shopping. But I have to admit that sometimes I don't really like shopping above all when I'm tired or when I'm not in the right mood. In fact if I'm not in the right mood I become nervous because I can't find anything. For me, the best moments for the shopping are two opposite situations. For the first situation happen to me, when I'm hungry with somebody really close to me like my boyfriend or a component of my family, so for relaxing my mind I go to shopping and usually I enjoy  a lot. The opposite situation is when I pass my exams and I really need to buy something for me as a preseant for myself. ",27.0
1091," Dear Mr Robertson, I am writing to you concerning our three days which we are going to spend in London. I would like to thank you for the programme which you have organised for our English class. It sounds very promissing. Especially the trip to Greenwich. But there is something else which we would like to see. We have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and we all would like to go there. It would be a great opportunity for us, because we are all interested in fashion particularly in sports wear. The show is going to be in  Central Exhibition Hall on Tuesday 14th March from 10.00-19.00.. The entry for students is free. I would suggest to visit the Science Museum, which was planned for Tuesday, on Wednesday afternoon. So that we can go to the Fashion Show. And if there is anybody who wants to go shopping, he would be able to do it on Wednesday evening. We are looking forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.  [SEP]  It was dangerous but I knew I had to do it. For just one day in my summer holidays I planned to do something adventurous. The moment I saw the advertisement about one of the seven world wonders, I knew, I had to see it. But this was also the moment when my nightmare started to come alive. My friend and I had just arrived at a small airport in the middle of the Californian desert. One man came out from a small building. It was our pilot. He introduced himself and we walked towards a small plane. The doors of the plane were so thin, that I thought I could torne them. We went inside and the plane took off. It was horrible. I could feel every movement which was caused by clowds or winds. I thought we would die. But then, finally, we reached the Grand Canyon. I didn't know what to feel. It was amazing. We were so near that, I thought I could touch the sides of the Grand Canyon by reaching out of the planes window. I swore to myself, I would never ever take a plane like this again. It was too dangerous, but I knew deep inside I had to see it. ",35.00
516," Dear Manager, I am writing to you about the musical Show 'Over the Rainbow' I saw in London last weekend. To begin with , it was not Danny Book who acting in the show, as you wrotte. Secondly, the time  in your advertisement told that it should start  19:30, but it did not start before 20.15 And then about the tickets, you wrotte that they were discounts available but they were not. Finaly when we had seen the Musical, we went to the restaurant and it was closed because they done some dekoreting, and you wrott in your advertisement ""Visit our theatre restaurant after the show"" We are very disappointed, it was not a perfect evening out for us, therefore we would  have your money back. I  looking forwart to hear from you. Yours faithfully, HELGAR Svessen,  [SEP]  Clothes in the future Clothes is  very interesting subjekt to study. If you travlling around you can see  lot of different still from different culture. At first I think that in the future we are going to wear less clothes because the climet are being warmer and warmer. Secondly I think we have more mixing clothes from all over the world, because we are traveling more and more around. And that is nice if you can pick up the best thing from all over the world, but on the other hand it is not so nice if every country wear  some type of clothes. Finaly about my oppinion I wish we are going to dress us more as  in the past with nature matrial, we most think more about the eviorment and leave closer to the earth. ",20.0
368," Dear sir or Madam, I have recently had a week's holiday in London and, during my stay, I went to see the musical show 'Over the rainbow', which was shown at your theatre. At first, the advertisement said that there were discounts availables, but when I went to buy the tickets there were not any discounts. As if this was not enough, the show, instead of starting at half past seven as the advertisement said, started at a quarter past eight and one of the main actors, who was supposed to be Danny Brook, was someone else. On top of everyting, the restaurant which was announced in the advertisement was closed because it was being arranged. You can imagine how dissappointed I felt after that evening, and I am writing to ask you for a further return of part of the money. I am looking forward to hearing from you soon. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  I think modern technology hasn't changed my life a lot, but it has in some things: I work with music and with graphic design too, and computers help me a lot in this things. In music, before  having a computer I could only write my compositions and 'listen' to them into my mind, because, of course, I haven't got an orchestra to play them, but now I just can record one part, and then another part, and then another one.. and I can get the sound of every instrument controlling it with a keyboard, or even create new sounds. In graphic design, before  having a computer I just could draw, but now I can create pictures pixel by pixel, develop ideas more easily, or take photographs into my computer and transform them or mix them. But, in other things, I think modern technology hasn't changed my way of living too much: I do more or less the same as I did some years ago: I get up in the morning, go to school, have lunch, study and go out with my friends without being afected by microchips or nuclear energy.
