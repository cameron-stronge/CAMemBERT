371," Elise-Lune 48 1093 La Conversion 17th June 2000 The Manager of The Circle Theatre Dear Sir, Last week, I went to London in your theatre to see ""Over the rainbow"" and I had a disappointing evening. There problems were; Firstly, the famous actors Danny Brook and Tina Truelove weren't there for your musical show, I was unhappy to constat that it was different actors this evening. Secondly, the show of 19:30 only started at 20:15; Thirdly, your advertisement said: ""Discounts available""; but it wasn't the case. Fourthly, the restaurant was closed for renovations and you don't have to propose us to go. Like you can see, I'm very disappointed for this evening out and I think it was a waste of time and money. That's why I ask you to give  my money back. I ask you give me £20, back by check. I'm looking forward to hearing from you.  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed your daily life? The technology is the future, and the present. For instance,  internet. All the world is now connected on it.  Internet is the ""new"" revolution of the communication and knowledge. It is now ten years that  Internet exists, but we only  used it for army and government . Now, everybody who work in  commercial companies use every day  Internet. The technology means too, every electrical machines, which don't stop to be developped. Another example, computers, every six months, something better is discovered. The modern technology has changed my daily life in every day. For instance, the meats, we don't cook our meals, everything is already done. Five minutes in the micro-waves and it's ready. The machines have replaced the work of the humains. We use every day technological machines without to know. All our life is symplifying by the machines for not waste the time to work on their developpment. ",25.0
833," Dear Helen Ryan, I am writing to reply  your letter saying that I have won the competition, which I can't believe. I am so excited by the news. I think I can take this opportunity in July because I run my shop all year round except three weeks in July. I would like to have accommodation in log cabins as I find sleeping in tents very uncomfortable thought it may be a new experience. It would be nice to have a chance to try  new sport when we are relaxed. I'd like to try golf because I'm not good at any other sports. Besides golf, taking wonderful photographs of sceneries has been my dream, even though I am a beginner. I'd like to ask about what clothes we need, what the weather is like and whether we need some spending money or not. I'm looking forward to going on this fantastic holiday. Yours sincerely.  [SEP]  Dear Kim, How are you? I know you have been waiting for my letter. But as you know, I have been so busy that I couldn't write earlier. Actually I didn't use to enjoy pop music much. My classmate Cecilia persuaded me to try  whole new experience of helping at a pop concert. I thought it would be the last thing I wanted, but it wasn't. I've really enjoyed this opportunity. We delivered so many fantastic and gorgeous costumes which had been designed exclusively by top designers. We also helped to make posters and leaflets, which I enjoyed most as I always like drawing and designing. The most difficult work was to arrange  coach trip to the concert hall as there were many audience from  countryside. It was too complicated. But the rest of the preparation was so good. I've realised pop stars are just like us, down to earth. They were so kind and modest. Do you know what I liked most from this experience? I've found pop music so wonderful, it changed my idea of that classic music is always best. Of course, I've enjoyed being around famous singers, too. Love ",34.0
884," Dear Sir/Madam. Firstly, I would like to say that I am surprise to received the letter from you. I read the information as you gave to me, it is very interesting. It is very good due. According to Camp California in the U.S.A. I expect to traveling on July because I will have a long holiday break on that time and my children have to go to France with student's school on July as well. I think, it will be  very good time to traveling by without worries. How is about an accommodation. I prefer to live in tents because I feel very natural. Can you imagine how exsiting  when we stay in the dark and very quite and we can hear a sound of  animal. How's amazing that? When I arrived there, I would  to  painting and take a photography  because both of its was my hobby. I have been doing a lot of them when I have got a free time and when I feel empressted  where I have been. I think I can do it very well. Fainally I would like to ask you about I have to spent any money over there without my shopping and how is the weather over there on July because I will prepare the clothes as usedful. By the way I have to say thank you very much for everything that you was offer me and I look forward  the further information from you. your sincerely ZITA ZALAI  [SEP]  Dear Kim, How are you? It was  very long time as I didn't write the letter to you. I hope, you will feel better when you finished my letter. Today I  going to write about the experience of helping at a pop concert as I went from last month, it has got a lot of thing to talk about. Firstly it is about the hall which they used for  concert. It is  very big hall including the sound system and the light at the steat. It was brillian. Secondly it is the super star as they came to show at  concert. They are very cool. By the way I had done many thing in that concert. I had to connect with people who  responsible about  ticket. They had to check when people came in the hall and I was the one who checking the tickets as well. You know, you have to very strongly when you have to do that because when people came in they couldn't weait to go at  frount and they are try to go over very quickly. So you have to explaining too many time to make people clamed down and standed in the row. It was very hard for me and I won't do it again. In the further more if you want to go there. miss you, ",19.0
370," Dear Sir, I am writting this letter because I had a week in London last month and I decided to see your show called ""Over the rainbow"" with my wife and children. We were disappointed because your advertisement was a misleading one. First of all, the most important singer, Danny Brook, was not singing. You should have at least informed the public because most of the people  came to see him. However the man who took his place made a good performance, we enjoy listening to him because his voice was amazing. The times were not respected: the show began 45 minutes late. The children could not stand waiting outside in the cold. As it started later, it finished later and people missed the train they wanted to take. Furthermore you did not apologise as if it was usual! In my opinion, the tickets were a little bit expensive and not many people could afford the price. We did not see any discounts! Finally your restaurant was closed because too few people came before. I understand them. After such a bad show you don't want to eat in the same place. For these reasons I would like to have my money back because it was not a ""perfect evening"" as you said. But I think that if you take care more of the public, your show would catch on because the singers and songs are really impressive. Yours Faithfully  [SEP]  Modern technology is everywhere in our society. We use it daily and sometimes don't realize that things are changing in our daily life. The ways of transport are improving a lot this times. The cars are really useful and a lot more faster than waking or cycling. But cars created pollution: for exemple the green house effect. But it is also the technology which try to resolve this problem with new way of transport  as subways or busses so as to have less cars in the cities. Technology allows us to improve our knowledge in  sciences like medecine so as to cure more illnesses or to make people live older. I think there is a link between technology and  sciences because they need each other:  sciences discover technologies and technologies make possible new searches in  sciences. Technology also improved the communications with the phone of course and also with  Internet. Every evening when I come back home I go on the internet. I chat with other people in order to exchange our points of view or I look for informations I need for my studies. In my opinion it's a lot better than the dictionnary because it's faster and you really find what you need. Furthermore we can find everything all the time. Technology is necessary to our society but I think it could be also dangerous if we don't use it in the good way.  ",30.0
456," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to complain about The Circle Theatre which is very different from what it have shown. I will let you know about what I have in mind. I went to your theatre last saturday,  about 7. p.m. I asked for discounts. But a clerk said that  time for discounts had been finished. I did not care about  money and I rushed into  and then took a seat with some food. I was waiting for the show that was supposed to start at 7.30 p.m. But it started at 8.15. I felt nervous. When I saw an actor, he was a different actor. I was very upset and disappointed. After the show ended, I was on the way to the theatre restaurant. What was more, it closed because of refurishing. If you were me, how would you feel? So, I could not help to writing to you and would like to take money back. I enclosed the receipt of theatre. Yours faithfully, Bying Kak  [SEP]  - How has modern technology changed your daily life? I was born in 1973. At this time, our nation was under a developing country. Almost all the people had a Television which provided events around our county very quickly. As I growed up, T.V was one of the mysteriest things like a telephone and a bus. When it comes to modern technology, I grately appreciate it. First thing is a computer. When I was a university student, I had to find out some imformation about my homework. I could not get them. but a computer made me get them from  internet. Second thing is an airplane. I have been imagining where another contries are like England. Now I am in England. I know a ship but an airplane made an arrival to here be quick. Third thing is a telephone. It saves time. Whenever I do not know about something, I phone  and ask  it. All in all, I have been having many benefits from modern technology which is very useful. But it might be a problem, making me lazy. Now, the world is one end and I have to take advantage of modern technology for my future. ",20.0
96," Dear Manager of the Circle Theatre. I am writing regarding to our visit to the Circle Theatre  the 17th June. When we saw your advertisment for the musical show, over the rainbow, we immediatly decided that this must be a perfect evening out. There was in our opinion two reasons for that, our favourite actor Danny Brook and the opportunity to visit your theatre restaurant afterwords. However the evening become very disappointing. Firstly, Danny Brook was not acting, there was another unknown actor and he was not good. Secondly, the show was supposed to start  19.30, but did not start until 20.15. Thirdly, in your advertisment it says that discounts should be available, but it was not. Above these the restaurant was closed because of  water leakage. I am therefore asking for a compensation for our disappointing evening and hope we can reach a sollution as soon as possible. Yours sincerelly Adra Johansson  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. It didn't take more than one day before everyone knew about my decision. I had thought about it for many years but never been able to fulfill my dreams. This year I had the opportunity to make my dreams come through. However I wasn't sure if my decision was right and therefore I decided to discuss it with Pat. Pat is my best friend, since we first met in primary school. It is now twenty years ago. I really like Pat, she's funny, has a good sence of humor and like me she loves to discuss everything. So therefore, my choise to ask her about my decision was the best  I could do. She really listen to me and told me that I did the right thing and persuaded me to send in my application for an language course in England. I wanted to keep this as a secret until I received the answer from the School. But it is ok, I still like Pat, even though she can't keep a secret. ",27.0
669," 13th June 2000 Dear Mrs Ryan Regarding your letter dated on the 6th of June I'm so happy to receive the first price. Thanks very much. I would like to travel in July to California. The reason is that we have long holidays at school on this time. Although, the accommodation isn't so important for me. I would prefer the log cabin because of the comfort and the better bed. I have choosen the activities surfing and photography. I'm a beginner on both activities. I have some questions as follow: 1. What kind of clothes are needed? 2. What  I have to pay by myself? 3. Should I take some money with me? 4. How is the wheather in California? I'm looking forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerelly, A. Becker  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable Most of the time is shopping fun and enjoyable. There are a lot of reasons  that could be awful to go shopping. Even if you run out of money or you have to buy a particular thing which is difficult to find. I had once this problem. I was looking for a special fruit. The sales assistants in the stores aren't so nice and helpful. Sometimes they give me a bad feeling as ,,customer treat with order"". Last week I was shopping with my younger brother. Awful. He wanted everything what his eyes saw. All the stuff for children are in the same level as they have their eyes. Afterwards, I felt tired and unsatisfy  the store. The shops have bad opening times. When I feel me comfortable for shopping everything will be closed or you haven't enough time to look around. My conclusion on these points are not so bad. I like shopping at all with my best friend.

201," Dear Sir or Madam. A few days ago I went to your theatre to see a musical show. Unfortunately I was very disappointed with it, I was expected  opposit. First of all the advertisement where you have advertised your program and what the theatre was providing for you is totaly wrong. A came to look at my favorit actors Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, but  whom I saw were another people. Another thing is that I took a particular amount of money to buy a tickets and when I apeared infrant of  casses I found out that the cost of  tickets on your advertisement and  real price wasn't the same,  real price was much higher. Also  show started very late compere to what was writen on the advertisement. And I think you know how it is just sit and wait for 45min. befor the beggining? So, after all of that, I wanted to have a nice relaxing diner in your restaurant, I was very angry when I apeared infrant of closed doors and there was a notice, that the restaurant wasn't working. In fact  writing to you just with one main reason. I'll be really delightful to resive back the money for my ticket. I'm looking forword  hearing from you. Faithfuly yours Lena Jarova  [SEP]  Begin at the begining. Look at  historical books  400-600 years ago, or even in  time of  First and Second World War,  how are sociaty changed, just because we did step up in the  science and technology. In one hand scientist discovered a lot of medisent from different illneses, but in an enother hand they discovered many illneses about which we haven't herd before. I think this side of the question is balanced because before  effect on our health was less than it is now. More and more people died from some illness wheres  long time ago less people died from  illneses, dispite that fact that they had less medisent. However technology nowerdays impoved so much and it changed our life a lot. Today we can't even think how we could possibly leave without computers or without airplanes. Computer it is our way of with  outside world comunicat, wheres with airplanes we can rich our parents, friends easily and much faster, then if we would  use bouts or trains. Everyday scientist and technologyst discover and produce more and more new things and it is good, it has to be like that, we have to do forword not behind from the point where we are now. Society has to go forword not to stop on one place. ",20.0
193," To the manager of The Circle Theatre! I have been recently in London and I've seen the art ""Over The Rainbow"" at The Circle Theatre. I have to say that it was a very disappointing evening for me. It should start at 19.30 and it had at 20:15! There were no discounts available and the theatre's restaurant was closed. But the worst thing in ""London's newest and best musical show"", as you called it, was the abscentness of Danny Brook. The actor wich was ""dancing"" was horrible. He had been mistakeing all the time. At the advertisement, there was written ""your perfect evening out"". Well, it wasn't perfect! I want you to give me back my money, I hope that in future you will corect all this mistakes. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. I told him my worst love story. One day, I was going to school by bus and  I don't know why  I went to the end of it. I looked up and I saw her, standing next to me with her friend. Every time when I looked up at her my legs were shaking so I couldn't come up and talk to her! But with help from my friend who convinced me to do this, I've met her. Her name was Sue and she was so beautiful that I still can't find words which could be good to describe her. I was constantly seeing her but my shyness made my mouth close so I couldn't say anything! I was in Love but that wasn't nice. Few days later someone told me that Sue was actually a boy! That was supposed to be a joke from my ""coleagues""! From that moment I feel like I have been in front of a video camera and the operator of it is me! I couldn't speak to anyone. The worst thing in this story is, that Pat told this to everyone at school. From that moment I live alone. Thanks to Pat. ",23.0
637," Austria, 13th June 2000 Dear Mrs. Ryan, I refer to your letter in which you informed me that I have won the first prise in the competition. You asked me for some further information and hear are my ""desirs"": I would like to travel only in July because in August I have to study for an exam. Further I would prefer to live in a tent at the Camp, because I am already used to that, because I often spent my holidays in tents. I would like to do painting, because one of my greatest hobbies is silk-painting and so I think I can improve my abilities. The second activity, which I choose is playing basketball, because I love this wonderful sport. We always play it at school and I am very good at it. I am in our school-basketball-team. I hope that you are now well informed and I would like to ask you which clothes and how much money I should bring with me. Thank you very much, I look forward to hearing from you. Your sincerely  [SEP]  Austria, 13th June 200 Dear Kim, I hope you are fine. You know, last month I helped at a pop concert and I am sure you want to know some details. My first task was to open the doors to let in all the fans of Britney Spears. I stood at the entry and theire I had to check the tickets. Two girls came together and they wanted to go in with only one ticket for both ! I had to tell one of them, that she had to leave. She started crying. Such a poor girl. At this moment I didn't like my position. My second task was that I had to look in all the bags of the fans to collect ""dangerous"" items, I saw really funny things like teeth-bruches in the bags. This part of my work was really funny and I enjoyed it. Summing up I can say that it was a fantastic day, because Britney sang so beautiful and the performance was also super. I hope you can imagine how a wonderful day it was for me. Yours ",31.0
674," Dear Ms. Ryan, Thank you very much for the kind letter you have sent me. I am very pleased and very excited that I have won - I can't wait to go to the Camp! At present, I am taking my exams and am fully occupied with studying. However I will be free in July - but please not that this is the only time I'll be free to travel to California. For the accommodation, I would like to stay in tents as I have never slept in one before. It would also be a chance to try it out for the first time in my life. I would also like to take tennis and painting activities while staying at the camp. I've played tennis for eight years now and have competed in many matches. I take painting as my hobby as well, even though I have never took proper lessons. Also, can you please be kind enough to tell me what sort of clothes I should take? Would the weather be quite hot? Would you recommend me to take an extra bottle of sun block? Lastly, can you please tell me how much money would be appropiet to take? Would there be a bank near the camp? Thank you for taking the time to answer my questions. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely, MIDORI FUYU  [SEP]  Dear Kim, Hi! How are you? Thanks for your letter. You want to know everything about the concert? Okay - here it goes! Two hours before the concert began, I arrived at the hall. God, I was so excited! Already everything was set up, the groups instruments, lights, microphones... I quickly helped others to decorate and to 'polish' off the hall - we blew up as my balloons as we can and sprayed them with gold and silver. The concert went terrific, too! There must have been hundreds out there - dancing, laughing, shouting.. and I was having a time of my life! I handed out refreshment to the pop group's members during breaks - my friends were so jealous of me! At the end of the concert, when it was after midnight and everyone had alread left, the group came up to each of us (who helped out) and thanked us personally! I mean, isn't that really nice of them? We shook hands and they even wrote (scribbled?) their signatures on my T-shirt! I guess this was the best part of the night! Really, Kim, you should try this out some time. Even though I was exhausted, it was really worth it! Anyway, now I'm back to the real world - I have exams next week, wish me luck! Best wishes, ",37.0
814," Dear Helen Ryan, I am so glad that I have won this competition - two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. I would like to travel in the middle of July because my summer holiday starts in the middle of July. Is it possible to travel in July? And also I like to camp in a tent, because it will be more interesting than log cabins. You need to do everything by yourself. Taking a photography during the holiday is  very good memory for me, and I can share my adventures to my friends. So while I am at the Camp I like to take many photographies and climb a mountain. Fresh-air, flowers and meeting some interesting people while you are climbing you have. By the way, I wonder if I need a lot of money and what kind of clothes I should bring. Finally, thanks for giving this opportunity to me I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely 13/06/00  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable Shopping sounds very enjobleable and  fantastic for women. You can find a lot of interesting things which you unexpected. Some people enjoy window shopping, but some people enjoy spending their money on their clothes or shoes. Nowadays in a family shopping isn't  women's job. In other hand, after shopping you'll get tired and maybe you can't afford your credit card. For instance, you want to buy everything which you saw, and after that, you don't know how much you have spent. If you are going shopping someone can easily steal your wallet which you are looking at some interesting things. It will be very awful. However, shopping has pros and cons, it depends on personal thinking. I enjoy shopping very much, it can let me know what's going on in the world. But it is a good idea to have a break during the shopping ,  you won't feel so tired. ",24.0
1135," Dear Mr Robertson Thank you for the good programme which you have organised. There is only one thing we don't agree with you , it is the  Tuesday 14 March. We have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show. and we would all like to go to this show. It would be very special for us because we haven't seen something like that before. There are four different shows. First there is a show with  latest fashions, after they show us the leisure and sports wear and then there are the make up and the hairstyles shows. The show is not as expensive as the Science Museum because the entry of the show is free for students. You see, the programme has only to be changed on Tuesday morning. In the afternoon we go shopping  how you have organised in your programme. In our opinion; it is enough to go one time in a museum and it is on Wednesday . Thank you in advance for your trouble Yours sincerely your English Class 4A  [SEP]  The Home of the Future Now, we are in the 21th century. Most of us live in houses or flats and it is most very comfortable. But in which kind of homes will people stay in the future? What will be different and what wont change? We can need our imagination for answering these questions but we will never know the right answer. I have further ideas: In the futur, maybe in 2113, there will are houses like now but only with more technical things. The life at home will be more easy because  a refrigerator which fill up itself or a bathroom which clean itself. So, people wont have to clean their houses because there are  machine for all  works. But I think that people will altough need a bed and a table with a chair. These things and a lot more went change or wont be forgotten. So, I think. houses only will be more moderne and more practique but not very different from our home in the present. This is my idea and we will see! ",26.00
502," Dear Sir, I am writing to your to complain about the musical show called ""Over the rainbow"" As a matter of fact, I waited for seeing Danny Brook who I appreciate a lot and I was very disappointed that he wasn't here. Besides, the actor who filled him in was unknown and specially boring. Secondly, the show had to begin at 19.30 pm, in fact he began at 20.15 pm and that without any explainations! Your advertisement mentioned that discounts were available, however when I asked for them to the staff they replied to me that they weren't  discounts! After the show, I wanted to visit your restaurant and once again, I was disappointed because it was closed. Anybody could explain to me why! I can assure you that it wasn't a perfect evening out and I got very annoyed about this evening which could have been wonderful. That is the reason I would like you to refund my money. I hope you would take notice of this complaint seriously. I am looking forward to hearing from you as soon as possible. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  My daily life changed in some ways when I got the hand of using new technologies. When I started work, I wrote everything I made on sheets and if sometimes I made mistakes, I had to cross  out and it wasn't very well-made. I had to work out all my figures two times to make sure that my accounts were accurate. Now, I enter datas and I don't need any more to calculate my figures, the work is completely made by the computer and in addition there is no mistake. If I have to find out  timetables, it is very useful to have the possibility to see  on the Internet, besides, it is the quickest way! At the beginning, I wasted a lot of time getting some information I needed because I didn't know exactly where I had to look for . But after a while you gain experience and you get soon used to this kind of research. Another thing that has changed my daily life is the mobil phone. As a matter of fact, if I am stuck in my car in the traffic, I can call my boyfriend to tell him that I would be late. Once, I saw an accident and I could call the police. Sometimes the ring is annoying but finally, the mobil phone is a great handy object. ",30.0
425," Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Now all the town knew my secret. This is a very embarrassed situation. I have to leave this town. My god, I never should have told my sister this secret. This story started when I arrived to this town with  family. We come here to build our own house because my father had been fired and we had to sell our house in Buenos Aires. My mother suggested to come here because one of her brothers was established here and he could help us. I hadn't known all of us (my uncle, my aunt and my beautiful cousin) up to that day. My uncle, called Paul, offered us to stay with his family up to we could build our house. Cassually my cousin had the same age as me, sixteen, that's the reason for we started a friendly relationship. We spend all the time together. This ""friendly"" relationship was starting to make hot. I  never had a boyfriend and I felt in love with him. One day in the , he kissed me. It was wonderful. I felt that I had discovered other ways. In fact, I did. We made love...

286," Dear Sir, I'm writting to you to make a complaint about your musical show: "" Over the Rainbow""... Last week, I, my husband and our two children went to your theatre spend a good time, but we were so disappointed. First of all, I think it's not professional to change the principal actor in the last minute, the play should be with Danny Brook, but it wasn't. In addition to this, the show started at 20:15 instead  19:30, more  45 minutes in late... Moreover, there weren't  discounts available like writting in your advertisement. There was well a restaurant, even though, it was closed for reparations, also 2 hours 30 without drinking or eating something, was quite difficult for the children. It should be a perfect evening out, but it was the opposite. It's why, it would be grateful, if you could give me my money back. I look forward to hearing from you in the very near future. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed your daily life? Nowadays, I think it could be impossible for us to live like our grand-parents or great grand-parents lived... we are too lazy, but it's not our mistake, this revolution is called ""progress""! Every day, like everybody, I watch the TV, see the International news, hear the radio, play games on my computer or get across with American or Asia people without going out to my house. It seem be incredible, but it's commun habits for us.. we don't think that there is less of a hundred years , nothing of that existed. I will always said thank you very much to the inventor who has invented the maschines wich make the washing and the washing-up, before this, the women spent a long time had done this tasks. In addition to this, thinking also, to the medicine, science or astronomy progress... And it's not ending, I hope that for my thirties I'll go to Mars on holidays... The scientists are again ten years to find the solution... ",29.0
436," Mr Jon Stevens, Last month I have been in London for a week to visit your wonderful city and with the intention of seeing at your Thetre the famous musical show Over the rainbow but in all my life I have never had such a disappointing evening. First of all my cousin, who lives there, had had many problems with the tickets. The starring changed and this was the worst surprise I could have . My greatest wish was seeing Danny Brook's performance; you know it's the best singer. But instead of him there was a unknown young actor. What a pity, I thought. I arrived there in time, 19:15 in fact you wrote that the show would be starting at 19:30, but I had to wait until 20.15. What an absurd thing, don't you think so? The quality of the show wasn't as high as I expected. I hadn't tought for a restaurant to go to after the show, because if the advertisement had been right, there should had to be a luxury restaurant where I could eat. But it was closed because it was under construction. Because of the quality of the evening I spent, the only thing you can do is giving me back at least the half of the cost of  ticket. To apologise and give the impression of being a serious theatre. I'd rather I had been at home seeing on TV my  Italy! I hope that my wish is being accepted. Your Sinceraly  [SEP]  We are in the ages of the technologic development  it's out of doubt. What could be out of control of technology? Since the scientific revolution and the Industrial Revolution, between  17th and 18th century there have been sudden changes in our daily way of living. Nowadays especially in the west area of the world science and technology have done great, enormous steps in directions of the progress. Not only for the great nations, but also for every  their inhabitants. Today it's absurd not knowing how a computer works, or how to use  Internet I can buy, today, a book   being comfortable at home, can communicate with other friends faster than before. I can have my homeworks done by a calculator etc. In  future I wish I could fly on my own! For me it's very important to have my mobile and computer never broken. I think I should become crazy without them, not only me but the majority of us. But sometimes I'd rather to switch them off and think of what I could waste, like love and friendship. I wish all the world would do the same. Vico says that progress gives up when Man have noticed that he have been wasting those values. ",23.0
1123," Dear Mr Robertson, Firstly, I am being the representative of my class to thanks  for organising a good programme in London, especially the visiting of  Science Museum and National Art Gallery. We know that it is a good chance for us to learn more different things and  can widen our knowledge in the Science Museum. In addition, we can appreciate and enjoy the art in  National Art Gallery. Unfortunately, I know that most of the students have already visited this two places before. So we decide to choose the other programme which have seen as an entertainment. It is the LONDON FASHION AND LEISURE SHOW. The show is hold at  Central Exhibition Hall, London. The date is on Tuesday March 14, from 10.00-19.00. It shows the latest fashions including leisure and sports wear. In spite of these, there is also make up and hairstyles which attract girls most. Secondly, the show is a great opportunity because it holds  only 1 day which is Tuesday March 14. And, it is free for students. So I think it is worth visiting. Personally, here is my some suggestions about how the programme could be changed. We can join the programme that you planned as usual and  we go to that fashion show on Tuesday. Finally, the above information is my opinion and I hope you can accept it. Thanks for your kind attention. Your sincerely,  [SEP]  How is the home of the future will be? Remain the same, as usual or have a great difference? For me, I think people's home may not be built on the ground. The home will be built on the sky - so as to save more land to build the other buildings. As the home is built on the sky. It will save a lot of electricity as solar energy is used. And, there should be a electrical servant in everyone's home. So there's no need for people to do the household work. There should be no beds at home because some pills are invented to make people not sleepy. If you're tire, the pill can give you vitamin, protein and make you refresh For electrical goods, there will be no any kind of electrical products except computer. People will do anything on the computer, including watching TV, listen to music,  chat with people. As the computer is being as a multi-functional products. on the other hand, there're some ways that remain the same. The toilet should remain the same as people need to use  daily and nothing can replace it. Second, there should be friends and family members in the home to provide joyful and fun. Since friends and family members won't change and replace, by anything. These are my imagination. I really wonder how the home of the future will be. ",25.00
984," Dear Helen Ryan I am writing to inform you about your question. At first, I would like to go travel on July, because before them I don't have time to travel. I have to finish my study. Secondly, I want to stay in  log cabin. I think it is more convenient than in tents. And I would like to have a chance about  painting and photography. I am not so fit and well condition, so I don't like to do activitily. However, to draw some beautiful sceanary and to take some picture are  very good experience for me. I hope so  much. Thank you for your invitation. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable. Do you like the shopping? Generally many women would like the shopping include me. Even the young girl wants to go shopping with mum. However, whenever you go shopping, are you usually satisfied with your choice and do you always enjoy the shopping? Perhaps you have an experience unpleased. You could go shopping for some rest to the high street or a department store. Then you could find the cheapest good and in that case, you probably buy it needlessly. Moreover  you bought something then you could find it is a little bit  expensive than the other shop. Both cases are often happened in shopping. If you don't want to regret about shopping, you have to make a shopping list firstly before going shopping. Then you should check the price and the quality of the good. If you remember these two things at least, you could enjoy the shopping. One more thing I recommend you is to leave your credit card at home if you are going only a window shopping. ",20.0

It could be wonderful to see you as soon as possible. First of all, I will be able to travel in July  because I have not finished school. Althoug I wich that my accommodation at Camp California it must be in  tents. I get experience in the last summer. Secondly, I am very keen at sports. Specially at sailing and swimming. Anyway I am hard working for the word cup at sailing. Finally, I would like to know how is the weather in July? Because I have to prepare all my staf and I am sure it would be a great experience despite the cost of living. I look forward to hearing for you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Kim, Hi, how are you?

274," Dear Sir or Madam, I am a foreign woman who had a week's holiday in London and decided to go to the theatre to see a musical show. That show wasn't as it  supposed to be and it is for that reason that I am writting to you. One of the problems is that a couple of actors, Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, were the ones supposed to act and a different actor took Danny's place, it was disappointing! The second show was supposed to start at 19:30, but to make the matters worse, it started at 20.15, so after the show I couldn't got to the cinema. Apart from that I couldn't visit the theatre restaurant after the show because it was closed for  holidays. On top of everything the tickets didn't offer any discounts, so  the last day I couldn't buy the present for my neighbour. I am writting to ask  a refund of the £55 which I spent on the ticket for the miserable show. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully. Jane Smythe  [SEP]  I am going to write about how has modern technology changed our daily life. First of all I think that technology has been one of the most important inventions of human  and that without it we couldn't be where we are wright now. One of the best examples is the car: in a lot of cities around the world, cars can be seen in the streets all day long. During the last decade the number of people who has a particular car has increased very fast. On the other hand people who hasn't any cars, can also be helped by technology: they can use the public transport like the train or the bus, which is also a comfortable form of travelling. But if you want a fastest  transport, the plane is the perfect one! But technology can also help you at home if you use modern machines for cleaning your house, clothes or dishes. Apart from that, technology also helps in hospitals. Every  time  more machines help doctors and nurses with their difficult tascs. In contrast, technology is very bad for the nature: if we use cars we contaminate , and many cars are being used every day! On balance I think that evidently technology has got more advantages than disadvantages. ",24.0
1091," Dear Mr Robertson, I am writing to you concerning our three days which we are going to spend in London. I would like to thank you for the programme which you have organised for our English class. It sounds very promissing. Especially the trip to Greenwich. But there is something else which we would like to see. We have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and we all would like to go there. It would be a great opportunity for us, because we are all interested in fashion particularly in sports wear. The show is going to be in  Central Exhibition Hall on Tuesday 14th March from 10.00-19.00.. The entry for students is free. I would suggest to visit the Science Museum, which was planned for Tuesday, on Wednesday afternoon. So that we can go to the Fashion Show. And if there is anybody who wants to go shopping, he would be able to do it on Wednesday evening. We are looking forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.  [SEP]  It was dangerous but I knew I had to do it. For just one day in my summer holidays I planned to do something adventurous. The moment I saw the advertisement about one of the seven world wonders, I knew, I had to see it. But this was also the moment when my nightmare started to come alive. My friend and I had just arrived at a small airport in the middle of the Californian desert. One man came out from a small building. It was our pilot. He introduced himself and we walked towards a small plane. The doors of the plane were so thin, that I thought I could torne them. We went inside and the plane took off. It was horrible. I could feel every movement which was caused by clowds or winds. I thought we would die. But then, finally, we reached the Grand Canyon. I didn't know what to feel. It was amazing. We were so near that, I thought I could touch the sides of the Grand Canyon by reaching out of the planes window. I swore to myself, I would never ever take a plane like this again. It was too dangerous, but I knew deep inside I had to see it. ",35.00
1086," To Mr Robertson, Firstly, I would like to thank you for the programme that you provided. It was  very good programme, especially the river trip to Greenwich, which I am sure the whole class would enjoy. However, our class has spotted an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and would all wish to attend. It will be held at the Central Exhibition Hall in London on the 14th March. It will be from 10.00 till 7.00pm. The show will be about all the latest fashion, leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles. We would also not have to worry financially as it is free for students. This will be a great opportunity for us because we will be able to find out more about the people of London and their fashions and style we might also get a change to meet new people and interest with them. The whole class is also very excited about this fashion show and would really appreciate your giving them a change to go. I have a few suggestion on how the programme could be changed to fit the London Fashion and Leisure Show in . We could do as planned for Monday and move going to the Science Museum from Tuesday to Wednesday afternoon. We would have to forgo the shopping as we might not have enough time and the exchange rate might be too high for us to do much shopping. We can however go and look around the shopping mall if we have time after the show. Lastly, I would be very grateful if you could give us your permission to go to the show. I hope you would consider this matter. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Everyday, something changes and we become more modern companies use computers instead of books, dentist use modernized electrical item instead of just a  plier, even homes are effected. From letters to emails, from gas stoves to electric stoves and microwaves, but we aren't just going to stop here are we? No, in the future, the present will be the past and these things now new to use will be old, outdated and changed. I see a very different home for us in the future. Most things will be computerised. We might even be using voice identification and fingerprints instead of keys. We an on and off lights with touch pads and remote controllers. We might even be able to open the door without getting out from the living room. Cameras will be something usual in every house instead of that little peephole in your door. Although all that may change our houses may be still the same. The rooms and size should remain as it was and the living rooms and all may still be decorated in the same style. We might still favour that old carpet and couch. The furniture should not change that much on the outside and the amount of rooms should not change too. In the future, every child might have a laptop. And instead of going to school, why not let school come to you? We will be learning at home using computers and disc. Never have to leave the house or wake up so early. Another way our home could be different in the future is probably the utilitles we are using. We might not need maids to do housework anymore as they can easily be replaced with a robot, a machine, or something other with the same purpose. Our homes will still be the same in terms of the kitchen, it will still be filled with vegetables and meat. This is because people won't miss the great taste of food although it could be subsituted to a vitamin pill or two. Lastly, I think that all this changes won't really be noticed as we change it daily and slowly instead  abruptedly. People will be able to adjust and change with the times. ",37.00
279," Dear Sirs, Two weeks ago, I came to London for a week's holiday. During my stay in your city, I had the opportunity to assist to your show named 'Over the rainbow' after having read an advertisement in the magazine 'Going-out' of the 1st of June . I'm writing to you in order to complain about this show. The problems started when we arrived at the Theatre: my 6 year old son had to pay  full price. Then, even if we could enter in the room, the show didn't start before 20:15, which is 45 minutes later than expects. Indeed, we are still waiting on Danny Brook who was not in the piece. And last, at the end of the program, we would like to have a drink in the theatre Restaurant, but it was already closed due to the poor attendance. As this evening was for my family and I a wasted one, I permit myself to ask you for  refund. I'm looking forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully JANN BRUL  [SEP]  There is no need to be a genious to notice that technology has evoluated so considerably during the last  decades that our everyday life has changed. From my point of view, modern technology has first permit to me to find a job as I work as a computer engineer. In this domain, you have to afford everyday the development of new technology. And as new discoveries bring new discoveries, progress is going faster and faster. The advantage of this is that you need to   interest yourself in all if you don't want to be put on the side. And so, your life is not boring at all as you learn new things everyday. In the other hand, you cannot stay quiet for 2 week as some new inventions come out every day. Finally, new technology have a great influence on my life as it permits me to live on. But, who knows, may be one day I will develop  technology that will send me right to the unemployment office!

164," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to you for explaining some problems I had when I went to the theatre to see one of your company's musical shows called ""Over the rainbow"". I would like to say that the information given in your advertisement was not true at all. First of all, the main characters had to be Danny Brook an Tina Truelove. I got very disappointed when I discovered Danny Brook was not going to play  and a different actor would play  instead of him. Another problem was  the start of the show. When I finished working I had to hurry up because the show started at 19:30 and it was 19:00. For my surprise, when I arrived to the theatre the show still had not started. All of us, who had paid a lot of money for those tickets, had to wait  long time before the show started, because it started at 20:15! You should review the advertisements you do because you give wrong information. For example, the advertisement said we could buy tickets with discounts, but when I went to buy it your employees told me there were no discounts available. When the show was over I went to have dinner to your theatre restaurant but I found it closed because your company is lacked of employees. In conclusion, what I expected to be ""my perfect evening"", as you said in your advertisement, was a very disappointing evening due to the problems I had. I would like to know if I could have some money back for these problems I have told you . I advise you to pay more attention in your shows and look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible. Yours faithfully, MANUEL SANTOS  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Two days ago I thought I could trust Pat because she was not going to tell anybody our secret, our important secret. I wish I had never told her anything. All began when, three days ago, I was doing  homework in my class. I was alone because Pat had to go with her parents to the cinema. Suddenly, I heard step noises that were getting closer to me. It was Paul, my teacher, who came to see what I was doing there. After a few words which I didn't pay attention to, my teacher went out the class. I was boried, so I decided to follow him to discover where he was going. He was going down the stairs wearing his blue jacket. ""See you tomorrow!"" I cried, but he didn't listen to me. Then, while I was going back to my class I saw he hadn't switched off the light of his room. I went to switch it off. As soon as I entered that room I realised he had forgotten our exams there. I couldn't believe my eyes! The exams we had to do  next day were there. Without thinking it twice, I took one of them and went quickly home. I had to phone Pat to tell her which were the questions of the exam. When I told her this piece of news, she got surprised. We thought we shouldn't tell it anybody else. Next day in the morning, before the exam, we were going to put the exam back with the other exams. But my plan didn't work well. Next day, everybody knew about my great finding because Pat hadn't kept our secret. The problem was that my teacher also knew  it because someone had told him ""the story of the exams"", as he called my big problem. He told me I had done wrong taking the exam but I think the only thing I did wrong was telling Pat my important secret. Next time I will get sure  who I'm telling my secret to. ",36.0
0," Dear Ms Jane Clark, Recently I visited an arts festival, organized with your help. I enjoyed it very much and I think the idea of its creation  is great. However, I have some proposals about its improving next year. At first, I propose  to invite stars and artists not from all  the world, but from only six countries. This change will give   opportunity to create some different performance. The second my proposition is about  classic concerts. I suppose that some concert halls are too small, so you should be sure about it  in advance. This year I noticed that there were only  few plays and films. From my point of view, there should be more films because this part of the festival is interesting for people. And, at last, I should congratulate you with the decision of making one weekend ticket for all events. I support this idea which is convinient both for  people and  organisators. I hope you will consider my proposals. I am looking forward for this festival next year. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Dear Ana, Thanks for your letter and postcard. It was really nice . The things you wrote about in your letter are quite common for me, because we, actually, have some problems about our rules. At first, about school. I'm really fed up with our school forne! It is awfull! And the problem is that nobody wants to wear it. That's why our headmaster is really angry. Off course, if we had such pretty forne like yours, we would wear it with pleasure. But it's impossible at the moment. What should I say  you about home... We are quite  friendly family, that's why we actually don't have some special rules. However, we promised our perents to make  cleaning up every week. This is all I wanted to write  you about rules. I miss you very much. I'm looking forward to see you next summer after my exams. Write  me  what do you think about it. Kisses to your family, ",25.00
395," Dear Sir or Madam, I'm writing to complain about the service you'd offered me last Saturday evening at The Circle Theatre. I've read your advertisement and it didn't say the truth. There weren't any discount available as you'd assured  in the add. I think you should check the information before print it! I arrived at the right time (19.30) that evening but the play, which was 'Over The Rainbow', started almost an hour later. And nobody told me why! When the play began I realised that the main actor had been changed and the new one wasn't good at all. I couldn't visit the theatre after the performance because it was closed for reparations. Why didn't you say something about it? I didn't have the 'perfect evening out' you'd promised so I want to ask for my money back because your service was terrible. Please answer my letter as soon as possible. I'll be looking forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully, Marcella, Scalia C.  [SEP]  'How Has Modern Technology Changed My Daily Life?' This is not a simple question because I got used to dealing with technology since I was a child but I'm going to try to explain  you how . I didn't have a computer until I was eight. Then my brother and I started to develop a new ability. In that time I used the computer only to play with its video games. When I was thirteen I discovered a completely different use for my computer. It became scencial to do my homework. And years later it enabled me to get a very good job. One day my mother got a terrible disease. She had to be operated on and my family and I were very scared. But when we talked to the doctor we felt more relaxed because he answered us that the operation was a very simple one. I think that if my mother had got ill ten years before, she wouldn't survive. The modern technology is better now than what it used to be. What do you think about this? I'm sure that these arguments have explained my point of view, haven't they? Now I would like to have your point of view. ",28.0

First of all I would like to suggested  you to come to our party and we would like  not to tell anything to your husband because the party is a surprise. The party will be organised on Tuesday the 16th of June at three to six pm at  college Canteen. We will have food and drink and we will have music because we know that Mr Brown loves music. At the party will come his students, the teachers and the principal. My last question is about  present. My fellow students have suggested to buy a CD or a Book. We would like  to tell us which is the best present for him. I am looking forward to hearing from you as soon as possible. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  John said he had some good news to tell me.

When we arrived at the bus-station I couldn't understand why he wanted to come there. But I didn't ask him. We wait there for an hour, and I was really angry. I wanted t know why we were there. At that moment we saw the bus to come, it stopped and one man come and sit near of us. I could recognise him. He was my father. I couldn't beleive  I have  to see him for five years.

320," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to complain about a musical show that I saw in your theatre. First of all, Danny Brook was supposed to act there, but he was replaced by another actor. This situation made me feel very disappointed. Secondly, the show should have started at 19:30 p.m., and it began fourty-five minutes later. Moreover, when I went to buy the tickets no discounts were avaliable. Furthermore, I wanted to have a coffe after the show, but when I tried to get to the theatre restaurant, it was closed. A police officer who was there told me that the manager of the restaurant was ill and that he didn't allowed anyone to open it. This was the worst night that I had during my stay in London. For all that reasons, I want you to refund the cost of the tickets and to send the money back to my house. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Her school's class-matters were going to give their friend Maria a party and it was going to be a surprise to her. They organized everything. The event was going to take place in the garden of Paula's house. Some of them were in charge of bringing music. The others had to bring food. That day afternoon they arrived at Paula's house in order to decorate the place. Ballons and coloured lights were put in all the trees. A table was laid with a lot of delightful food and a beautiful cake was in the centre of it. Some time later all the things were finally prepared. The garden was wonderful. The children were very enthusiastic because they thought that Maria was going to be very happy with this surprise. But things didn't happen as they had been planned. Because when Maria reached the house, they realised that she had been told about the party and they supposed that Pat had done this. ",31.0
1003," Dear Helen Ryan, I received your letter, so I write  you to give you some informations from me. I would like to travel on July because I finish school on June and I go to Great Britain on August for one month. If I can choose my accomodation, I prefer living in  tent. I prefer this accomodation because I think it's more easy to met people when you live in  tent, near them, than when you live in  log cabin. I want playing tennis and  swimming. I didn't play tennis before, so I am not good. I go to  swimming-pool two time by week, so I am good at this sport. Could you tell me what sort of clothes I will have to wear to play tennis? Could you tell me if I will need money for paid my dinners? Yours sincerely. Eric Durand  [SEP]  There is a lot of activities and lessons at our school, so I think it's difficult to chose some of them. I think the best choice is to show many types of activities. We could show  team spirit of our school with sport activities like soccer, basketball or handball. We could also show cultural activities: there is a lot of clubs of music or painting  in our school. I think it could be interested to show how students work to write the new paper of school. At the end, we can also show where we can be relaxed. We should filmed our pub and  room of students. All this activities which should be filmed, are  our daily life at our school. ",21.0

As you need more information, I answer all your questions with plesuare. Firstly, the Palace Hotel has been booked for your group. It is one of the most comfortable hotels in our sity and situated only half a mile from  main building of our college, so it is very simple to get from there to the conference by foot. Secondly, our end-of-conference party is included dinner and dancing, I would advise you to wear something not very formal. Finally, you can spend an afternoon on the last day visiting local historical places (castles, builded in  13-th century) or art gallery, as well as  beatiful Bodnant garden. I am looking forward to the meeting with you and  mutual work during conference. Your sincerely  [SEP]  There are many different people's inventions around us. We are so used to them, that sometimes  think they existed always. Some of them are very practical, other are rather strange. I thing, that one of the most importent and affecting our life inventions is the telephone. Imagine life without  phone. You are on the road, you have  car accident. What are you going to do without  phone? On another situation, your son is ill, he needs help urgently. I am sure, the phone has saved many lifes. Besides, it is always very nice to ring your friend or mum, only for chating in any time. Thanks  the phone, it is possible even your mam is on the other end of the Earth. To be honest,  next great invention of people,  computer, can't work, if you haven't got the phone. So I am very grateful to  man, who invented it, unfornutely, I have forgotten his name. It always happens with people, doesn't ? Try to ask who invented the will or the book. ",28.00
150," Dear Sir or Madam, I write to you to complain about the dreadful evening I had when I went to see your show at the Circle Theatre  the 9th june. To start with the famous actors Danny Brook and Tina Truelove didn't perform as told. They were replaced by some unknown actors who had certainly never performed  a musical. If I had only one reason to ask you for my money back; it would be the latter. But to add to this I had to make a long queue to get a full price ticket when instead I had brought my student card on the purpose of getting a discount which had been advertised but didn't in fact exist. The show which was to start at 19.30 only began at 20.15 and therefore me and my friends weren't able to find a restaurant when we had to because the theatre restaurant was closed on sanitary reasons. For this deceiving and  uncorrect advertisement and for all the given reasons, I ask you for an average refund of five pounds per ticket. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. This feature didn't allow you to tell him much about yourself. He wasn't really wicked, he merely didn't understand  to keep his mouth shut, especially at school where every little unimportant thing about your so called ""private life"" runs three laps around the schoolyard before you learn it although you are the most concerned about it and didn't even know. Well, some people just don't care, some are bothered and feel ill at ease. But  small drama can grow up as children are very sensitive. There is one point I want to make clear, I don't begrudge Pat anything. I believe this is a rule of society, it's a sort of group behaviour, and belongs to the childhood and the teenage . We all speak or have spoken of our neighbours, family, classmates, workmates, friends in bad terms. That is only human. According to me what is more to regret is when now we full-growns continue to act with this bad habit. The criticism spirit has to be preserved but we must keep our secrets. What allows us to reveal parts of someone others privacy, nothing. ",29.0

Firstly, I would like to travel there in July because it is the only month that I have free in my job. It will be impossible  another choise, but if you have any problem you will be able to advise me, although I prefer to go there in July because I think  is the best month to travel, the weather is nicer and warmer than in other seasons. Secondly, my choise is the accommodation in tents, I think it could be more interesting, I could enjoy my time with other people playing, eating and talking outside, in my opinion if I choose the log cabins it will be like be at home. About the two activities I need to select, I think the best one are swimming and painting. I choose swimming because I really love doing it, I used to swim every day in the sea a few years ago, I felt really healthy. My other choise is painting, I paint since I was ten years old, I used to go to special classes and I don't mind if you need me to help in the class. A thing I would like ask is if I need special clothes, I don't know what kind of camp I am going . It should be a dry place, I think but I would like to make sure my guess, as well, I would like to know how much money I will need, because it is also all paid I don't know if there will be some gift shops.

This is the thing that move hundred and hundreds of people in the world and we don't have to go to Japan we have the evidences here in England. But the question is: Is shopping always enjoyable? Some people think that going shopping can keep you away from depression. You can enjoy your time spending all the money you have, buying clothes, jewells, furnitures, etc. and you could have a real great time. But other people don't think like this, for example, there is a case of a woman who was shopping with her little daughter and without inttetion the girl get lost. The mother was shock, she didn't know how to look for her because all the shops and streets were full of people going out and in the places, it was  nightmare but fortunaly the police found her. Sometimes going shopping can be stressful. Can you imagen be in Japan or China and have to go to the shops? I don't thing that I'll enjoy it, all the people knicking you, you can't walk properly or buy something, and also there are  lot of cases which show how people can be in shops, I mean that some people can fight to get something. Where we are going!! In my opinion shopping is not the thing that I would like to do in my free time. I think that it's too stressful,  too many people in the shops, so I prefer spend my free time go swimming or painting and I go shopping in the days that usually there are not too many people. ",25.0
434," For the attention to the manager: I am writing to complain about the organization of the musical show that the Circle Theatre presented. Firstly, it was said that the stars who were invited to the estatement were Dany Brook and Tina Truelove. However, Dany Brook did not act and was replaced by another actor who was terribly disappointing on his performance. In addition, the event was supposed to start at 19.30 but we could not enjoy the show until 20.15. The advertisement for the show announced that we  were able to visit the Theatre restaurant after the show but it was closed due to the Chef who leaded the Restaurant did not remember to bring the keys to open it. Also, the advertisement said that discounts for the tickets would be available, but it was not. To conclude, I would be grateful if the organization of the theatre bring  my money back. yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets and she told her mother what had happened during the concert. Peter had a terribly problem with drugs. He started to consum the stuff at the age of twenty. He had problems at home because his mother wanted to settle down to Australia, but Peter was used to live in New York,  overcrowded and  surronded by people. Australia is a country too calm for him. We invited him to enjoy the concert of Texas but he started to make nonsenses because of the drugs. Firstly, he began to run around the crowd and also to hit the advertisements which announced the concert. A security guard saw it and put his attention on him. Pat stared at him and asked for help. The security guard heard her and agreeded with Pat that if Peter continued acting on this way he would obliged us to go out of the concert. He did it. When we arrived at home, Pat told to his mother what had happened. ",24.0
438," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to you to complain about the musical show I went to see last Wednesday. I was told I would have the most perfect evening in London, but it was not. When I bought my ticket I expected to be able to take advantage of those discounts you announced in the newspaper advertisement but when I had to pay the most expensive price. I went to see the performance at 19:30 but it did not start until 20:15! I was really angry but I wanted to see Danny Brook. My surprise was when, instead of Mr. Brook, a different actor appeared on stage. At the end of the show I decided to go to the theatre restaurant but when I arrived I realized it was closed because the musical show had finished too late! All I am asking for is a full refund of the money I spent in the musical. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Now Marion was really angry with her. Some days ago Pat met her friend Paul, the editor of the school's newspaper. Paul asked her some questions about her childhood and her toys because he was going to write an article about children. While Pat was talking she remembered playing with her dolls and spending a good time with them. Then Paul asked her if she knew something about Marion's childhood. Pat told him some unimportant things such as she learnt to swim at the age of five or that she loved ants. But, suddenly, she started to talk about Marion's toys. She told Paul she had a special toy called Max and that she slept with him. A terrible mistake! In the following edition the headline was: ""Why  a teenager sleeps with a toy called Max?"" Everybody laughted at her. Marion felt really embarrassed. Two weeks later everybody forbade about Marion's secret and she took into account her relationship with Pat. They became friends again. But Marion would never tell Pat a secret again!! ",37.0
115," Dear Manager, I am writing to complain about the Musical Show, I have seen last week. There is some disagreement a between your advertisement and  show, which I could see at the Circle Theatre. First of all, I would like to indicate that you put  wrong starting and finishing hours. The Musical started at 20:15 not at 14:30 - as you have mentioned. It was very surprising for me and I had got a lot of trouble with coming back home at night - when it finished. Furthermore, there was no Danny Brook at the stage. She is my famous artist and I was coming there mainly because of him. If this made me really disappointed - he wasn't playing there. Another point, I want you to consider, is  restaurant. The place you have offered was closed and there was nothing to eat inside the theatre at all. Despite changing the hours, you have closed the restaurant without any reason. Could you possibly explain why you didn't provide us  anything to eat? Finally, you have advertised, I would have  perfect evening out. Unfortunately, I can't say that. I am very disappointed and I would like to ask you for giving my money back. I think, this could be the only, right possibility for me, to forget about my not interesting evening. I would appreciate it, if you could consider my complaint. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  FASHION OF THE FUTURE Try to imagine: the wide, colourful street with many fantastic cars and shinny large shops. Try to think about people in weird black and grey clothes on them. It isn't a film, it isn't even a picture from mysterious books. It's a REALITY, its the FASHION OF THE FUTURE... People were wearing almost everything, during more than 2000 years of their living on Earth. Everything was changing: style, colour qual. Fashion. Their clothes were always strictly connected with their lifestyle, climate and money. We saw almost all kinds of skirts, trousers, coats, skirts and even hats - which untill nowadays are the main point of many fashion creatures. What can we suspect then? What something new hasn't been invented for now? I say it to you - black and grey. These are two powerful colours, which will be expanding for the nearest 100 years. The climate is changing, so we would have only two seasons. And we will need only two colours: grey for hot days and black for cold ones. Women will wear only skirts and dresses but men will be strictly connected with trousers. I hope, there will be times, when women would like to be again thought as delicate and sensible human beings. Showing their figure, they would have  possibility to show their sexuality. But, don't forget, any exhibitionism! We have too many taken off people around us, now. And it will be  the past. Streets of  21st century will be smart. So, are you interested in that style? Do you agree with me? If not, you are very poor. This fashion is coming, so think about it. Grey and black - like weather seasons, like people charakters, like all  night and dark sourranding us. These are the colours of the FUTURE. ",20.0
1036," Dear Mr. Robertson, We would like to thank you for this London trip and your programme related to it. It is  really good programme,  especially visiting  Science Museum and  National Art Gallery would be  great opportunity to learn about art and   latest improvements in science. However, my classmates and I saw the advertisement with regarding the London fashion and leisure show, which is enclosed, and want to take this opportunity to visit it, if you allow us. It takes place in  Central Exhibition Hall on Tuesday 14 March. It will be  great opportunity because it is free for students and we will be able to see the latest fashions in leisure and sports wear, new hairstyles and make up industry. Although according to your programme, we will be visiting  Science Museum in the morning and shopping in the afternoon, we would like to make a suggestion which can help us to be able to stick to both. Would it be possible to visit  Science Museum and go shopping in our free time on Wednesday in the afternoon,  instead of it to go to the London fashion and leisure show, because it is between 10.00 and 19.00 hours. Thanking  in advance, we very much hope that you will give your attention to our requirement. We look forward to hearing from you relating to this matter. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  One of the most important subject of the media is to inform people bout famous people such as politicians, films stars or successful musicians. In order to fullfill their readers' requirements they always follow them. This kind of people are known as paparazzi. it is not important whether they are working for media foundation or not, they just try to find the best pose. After taking their pictures in the way that these famous people would not allow them, they sell the pictures and make a fortune without asking their permission. This is the most argueing point. Do they have to ask for their permission or not. However, if they would ask, obviously they can not take the kind of pictures, which show them naked or when they are having  shower. May be they  have to pay for this kind of pictures. On the other hand, famous people have  point, if they do not allow  paparazzis to take their pictures. Because, althoug they are famous they have also their private life. Unless they do not want to share it, it must be acceptable for us. I think the best example would be Lady Diana. It was said that while they were trying escape from  paparazzis they had that accident, which caused of their lives. This can not be the way in finding information for the readers. ",37.00
969," Dear Helen Ryan, I am very pleased to hear that I have won first prize in your competition and  writing to you to offer additional information, as requested. First of all, I would like to travel in July because I am planning to visit my Mum in Korea in August. I also prefer staying in log cabins to tents. I have once experienced to have been soaked while I was sleeping in a tent dut to heavy rain several years ago. Once more reason is that I do not want to miss the chance to stay in a log cabin, which I have been dreaming  for a long time. How romantic it will be! As for my activities, as I took up playing golf since I was a child and now, I am a single-handicapped player, so I want to have  chance to play golf at camp. Moreover, I am very good at singing as well as playing the piano. In fact I have been playing the piano for  children's choir for 5 years. Additionally I would like to know which kind of clothes I should prepare. What's the weather like in California? How much money should I bring with me for  two week stay? I would be really greateful if you could send me some information or any relevant brochure. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Kim, How are things these days? Sorry not to write  you for a long time. I've been busy preparing  English exams. You remember I helped people at a pop concert as a nurse last month? You can't imagine how happy I am to have had such a wonderful chance. As you know, I've not been keen on pop music - I've always thought it was not only noisy but also even rubbish. It was not until the concert that I became a pop mania. It was really great to have talked with famous pop singers, bands, and TV stars. When a member of Venga boys came to the emergency center for the treatment of  electric shock on his finger, I felt I was short of breath. We usually are apt to think famous stars to be arrogant and nasty, but they weren't at all. It was absolutely our prejudice. They were very kind, soft, well-behaved, even modest. Their attitudes towards people, their costumes, their songs - everything was really fantastic. Fortunately there were few emergency accident so I could enjoy the concert without a hurry. I was definitely over the moon! I hope you can go  the next concert with me. Longing for hearing from you. Love, ",39.0
847," Dear Mrs Helen Ryan, Thank you very much for your letter. I am glad to be informed that I have won first prize in your competition. I am now writting this letter to give you further information about myself with pleasure. Firstly, the date I would like to travel on would only be in July. Since I am a full-time student, I will not have finished my lessons until the end of June. In addition, I will be busy with my cousework in August. Regarding to the accomodation, I would prefer to stay in tents because I think it will be closer to the nature. I am sure I will have a lot of fun and release myself from the busy study totally. I am pretty good at painting. I have won several prizes in the competitions which were held by my college. On the other hand, I started to play tennis at the age of six. Tennis is my favourate sports evant. So I would like to choose these two activities while I am at the Camp. Lastly, I have some questions to ask you. Since I have never been to  U.S.A, I know nothing about it. Would you like to tell me how much  should be taken with me as pocket money and what shall I wear at that time ?  I will be grateful for your help. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Best wishes. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable Shopping, is becoming a popular way of killing time nowdays. In some peoples' opinion, shopping and spending money is a kind of fun and they can even get self-satisfaction from it. However, more and more people are now asking, ""Is shopping always so enjoyable?"" In my view, the answer is, NO. Firstly, since more and more people go shopping, shops are always so crowded, especially the popular ones. Try to imagine the scence: twenty or thirty or even more people are keeping a quel outside the fitting room. Would you say that shopping is enjoyable? Would you be patient enough to wait for half an hour or more just because you wanna buy a T-shirt? Secondly, the cost is also a problem. It will be really an annoying thing when you are keen on something but you can't afford it. One of my friend, Emma, happened to see a fantastic jacket which costs £105. Then she spent all her spare time doing part-time jobs to earn money. After a week, she had got enough money and rushed to that shop. But it was just not there! She felt really badly after that. So, would you still say that shopping is enjoyable? More and more people find that there are a lot of nicer things they can do rather than shopping. Shopping is not always enjoyable. Sometimes it can be a waste of time. So, let's have a new life style in this new generation! ",36.0

About the accomodation, I would prefer  tents because I enjoy the contact with nature as well as camping activities. As I may choose the two activities I would like to practise during my staying at the Camp from the list given in your letter, I choose singing and photography. I have been taking singing classes since I was ten years old so I am pretty good at it. On the other hand, I am a beginner in photography skills. I would appreciate  if you could inform me if I have to bring any money for extra costs or even  special kind of clothes for those activities. Thanks in advance for your assistance. Yours sincerely CATARINA PONTES  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable These days people have been shopping more often than they used to. Sometimes shopping can be a stressing experience though people think of it as an enjoyable part of their lives. First of all, shopping can be a good thing if it is a possibility to forget about all the problems you have, even if it is just for a moment. It relieves you from the pressure of life while you are looking for something to buy. On the other hand, sometimes you can get really nervous about shopping like when you have to deal with unhelpful shop assistants. It is a very common fact these days and you have to be patient if you really want to buy something. Furthermore, sometimes you can not find a variety of goods and you eventually buy a low quality product. In conclusion, like all things in life, shopping can be pleasent or irritating depending on your patience and on your mood that day. ",34.0
398," Dear Sir or Madame, I was on  week's holiday in London and I went there to the theatre to see ""Over The Rainbow"". I must say that your musical show was very disappointing for me. ""Over The Rainbow"" was looking very interesting on your advertisement but  organisation and play was almost terrible. First of all I expected to see Danny Brook, but I saw  different actor and that was  big disappointment for me. Secondly the show started at quarter past eight. This is  fourty-five minutes delay. Moreover there was not any discounts and all of the tickets had the same prizes. Out the end your theatre restaurant was closed from unknown reasons, but on an advertisement  was clearly sign: ""Visit our theatre restaurant after the show"". That was cruel, because I was very haungry after the show. At the end of this letter I would like to ask if you can refund my money. I will be very pleased if  so. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfuly  [SEP]  Twentieth century was a century of inventions. Some of them are big and some of theme are small, but they effect our lives in the same way. Technology maked our life different than  life of people for example living in  nineteenth century. Modern technology makes our lives different, maybe better. Often people do not see how it effects our life style. Useful things like TV sets, radios, computers, Hi-Fi stereos and cars - we are dealing with them every day. They help us with daily life and make it more pleasant. Transport and communication without cars, trains, planes and telephones will not exist. We know our world from TV screens and computer monitors. Without these, and newspapers of course knowing our world could be hard. On the second hand people are suffering from modern diseases like addiction to television or computers. On the end we must mention modern medicine. It saves our lives from ancient and modern diseases. To sum up modern technology changed our daily life. Mine too. I think that I could not live  normal life without these inventions. They are like  air I breath. I am questioning myselfs - am I  sick man? ",25.0
323," Dear Sir or Madam, I'm writing to complain about your musical show ""OVER THE RAINBOW"", which I recently saw at the Circle Theatre. It was the only disappointment during my holiday in London, since several points didn't worked out as promised in your advertisement. First of all, there were no discounts available, and having payed £20 I had to wait 45 minutes longer than expected since the show began at 20:15 and not at 19:30. As a second point, the actor was not Danny Brook, as displayed, but someone else I've never had heard of before. His acting and singing was horrible. At last, after all these disadvantages, I was not able to have diner in your theatre restaurant. It was closed of some reason I still don't know. You see, it was not the ""perfect evening out"", as you had promised in the advertisement. Therefor, I would like to ask for at least half of my money back. I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon, Yours faithfully, Ewe P Meier  [SEP]  The pressure of secrets Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. And if he had been able to keep one, the following story wouldn't have happened. Pat was a teacher for english as a foreign language. Sometimes he had liked to surprise his class with a test to see how good they would be when they could not have learned for it in advance. And always, every body made it surprisingly well. What was the reason? Pat used to show the test to his friend Nick, when he had finished it to get his opinion. Nick now had taken a copy of the test to archive it. And the girlfriend of Nick happened to be in Pat's class. She was quite clever and had known everything about this, so she had taken copies for her classmates and everybody was prepared. You see, each little secret is a kind of pressure to Pat, and he only feels free if he can tell someone about it. And this is the same for everybody, isn't it? Or can you keep a secret? ",27.0

Actually this happened because the most things I saw were differend from what the advertisement had been written. First of all it had been written that Danny Brook and Tina Truelove were starring, but Danny wasn't there and somebody else took his place. This was the most disappointing thing I herd. Also you wrote that the show it was going to start at 19:30 but it started at 20:15. You ought to know that all the people hated to wait and started  the complains. The discounts weren't available and your theatre restaurant wasn't open, because the owners were for holidays. At last you wrote that it was our perfect evening out, but like I said before it wasn't. Actually it was terrible and I would like to have my money back. I am looking forward to taking your answer Yours senciarly   [SEP]  Unfortunatly, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. After we had had an argument she told all the school my secrets. She had really let me down. I met her before a year and from the first time we talk to each other we became friends. It took us a few time to became best friend and after that we were always together. Every day after school she went to my house or I went to hers. Always we were laughing and having  great time. I loved her a lot and I thought she felt the same about me, but I had wrong. Anyway, always I trust her  my secrets, because I was sure she wouldn't tell them to other people, even if some say we would be apart. But I was wrong again. One day, we went to a party, where she met some of the most pobular girls in the school. She started to act like them and speak like them. When I told her, she became very angry. and she left without saying nothing. After when I saw her, she laught at me and the next day all the school knew everything about me. I started to cry but later I got over it Now the only thing I care  is that she couldn't keep secrets and all the school is looking down on me. ",24.0
480," Dear Sir, I am from Brazil and I recently expent a holiday in London. During my stay I read an advertisement of a musical show being held at The Circle Theatre. As I was reading the advertisement I got very excited, because I am a great fan of Danny Brook, and he was going to be performing in the play. As I got to the theatre I asked for the discounts shown in your advertisement, but they were not avaible. Anyway, I decided to buy my ticket, since I thought the play was going to be good. So I sitted in my chair and waited for 45 minutes until the show started, that is an unacceptable delay. Even though I was still excited about the show, but then I sudently realise that Danny Brook is not performing, he had been replaced by an extremely disappointing actor. The night had been terrible, but it could be saved by a nice dinner in your restaurant, but it been closed because the heater was not working due to  leaking. As you can see it was not the perfect evening out your advertisement talked about. Then, I would be glad if you could have  my money back. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed your daily lief. Modern technology has brought  many discoveries which have made our daily lives much easier. For example,  internet has given us the possibility of acessing reliable information very fast. I guess science is about solving our daily problems with technological advances. That is exactly what happens to me. When I was younger I remember that when I had to study or to work on a school project I would take a lot of time researching on libraries, looking for old books. Today I can connect to the Internet and find all the information I need faster than you can imagine. But technology is not just about studying, it is entertainment too! I can watch pay-per-view films without having to go out to rent one. I can also listen to cds, play the latest games, watching concerts.. everything in a zap. You also have fast food, or food made in the microwave within a few minutes. As you can see, technology is about saving our time, so we may have more time to do what we like. In my opinion, technology is making my life much better because of that. ",32.0

A girlfriend of a member of the club asked me if I would like to help at the information desk. I did not hesitate one moment.

Some people came from Germany some from Austria and some came from England or the U.S.A. Talking English with the people from England or the U.S.A. was wonderful. They were all very kind and with some of them I spent the rest of the evening and also the following day.

I was wonderful news and as you have requested, here is some further information and details. I would like to travel in July as it is my summer holiday and is the most convenient time for me. At Camp California, I would preferably like to stay in a tent as I think it would be more enjoyable. The two activities I would like to do are Photography and Sailing. I think they are a good contrast. I have not done sailing for quite a long time so I might find it difficult but I am looking forward to it. As well as a good exercise, I would also  be able to learn something new. I have never done Photography before. I also have some enquiries concerning the trip. I would like to know what the weather would be like at that time of the year so I am able to pack the essential clothings. I would appreciate it if you also advise me on how much money I should take. It is all new for me as I have never been to the USA before. Please send me additional information soon. Thank you for your time and your kind effort. Yours Sincerely,  [SEP]  When you think of the word 'shopping' a smile always comes onto your face. Shopping is thought of as enjoyable. Teenagers go shopping for leisure and to socialize. There are more than one kind of shopping though and one particular kind is window-shopping. I would say window shopping is the reason why I have no money now. Sometime last month, I was just the same as I am now, with no money. My friend wanted to meet up with me so we made plans to meet up at a high street to go shopping. For me, that was window-shopping. When we went into the first shop, I caught sight of a long black dress. As I had nothing better to do, I tried it on. I fell in love with it. I knew thought that I couldn't get it - not yet anyway. I went back everyday just to eye that dress because I just couldn't get over the fact that I had no money. When I received my monthly pay, I rushed down to the shop and without thinking, bought that dress. I went back to where I was before - with no money (and a black dress) all over again. When I think about it now, shopping is not always enjoyable. ",39.0

It is always a great opportunity to enjoy a musical when you go on your holiday to London. London is one of Europe's biggest centre and you can always get the best in show business . Rescently I decided to watch Over The Rainbow, a very famous and wellknown show. Firstly, the night performance was 45 minutes late and there were no discounts available as the advertisement told. Furthermore, I was shooked when one of the main persons entered the stage. He wasn't Danny Brook, one of the resons for my choice . Finally, the Theatre Restaurant was under reparation so we had to find another one for the evening supper.

Why not talk about the social life just sitting around a table without no rush. In modern days we have to wear a mobile phone. I visited an airport some days ago and in nearly every crowded corner, I could see those busy people  always on their way . I heard the different phone signals, and what a miracle you can change them on the train when you are restless. A new word has appeared in those days, a technical proof of this is the computer. I can send and save information and the possibilities are uncountless. In nearly every home you can find it and the users now and in the future are the new generation. I must say a few words about the new electrical cars which surely will have a central role , exspecially today when fuel is so expensive. Watch out highly advanced technologies are appropriate and helpful for me and others if we only remember the importance of  time to be together. ",23.0
759," Dears Ms. Helen Ryan, I was really greatful when I recieved your letter which informed me that I have won first prize in your competition. I would like to make this trip the first week or the last week of July. Because my school finishes   end of June and I will have a month break  after that I have to do a computing course which I have already applied for it. Could you possibly tell me, at Camp California will I stay in tents or log cabins. Personily I prefer to stay in log cabins because they are much more comfortable than tents. I really enjoy swimming and playing tennis. Unfortunetley I am not good at both of them. Maybe I will have time to do enough practise as much as I always wanted to do. Could you tell me what sort of clothes I would need to bring with me and will I need any extra money for this holiday. I look forward to hearing from you soon! Yours sincerly,  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I don't know where to start but I can say it was the greatest time I have ever had. As I mentioned  you before  Friend of mine, she is a stage assistant and she needed a help for that pop concert last month. I told her if she need help I would be happy to help her. Next day when I went there I have met lots of people   very famous and very friendly. It took us almost a month to prepare for this concert. You wouldn't believe how hard it was. the stage was covered with all sort of light and we made it look like a waterfall. The waterfall made by real rock so that was the worst bit because they were really heavy and we had to carry them, but  the end of  moth when the concert started, it was all over. I sung and dance all day. I have lots of memory which I could never forget. I wish you were there. I hope you shared my happiness with me. Lots of love, ",25.0
529," Dear Manager, I saw your advertisment of your show in the circle theatre, over the rainbow. I went to it, but I was really disappointed about some thing. First the musical show, Over the Rainbow started at 20:15, and in the advertisement  was written  at 19:30, then  also was written that the actor was Danny Brook, but in the show appeared a different actor, that was really disappointing. Also  was written in the advertisment that some discounts were available, but there wasn't  discounts. And because of the time that the show started I couldn't went to the theatre restaurant because it was closed. Mr, I was very disappointed with the show so I want my money back, and I am sure you will understand my reasons. Yours Faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, and she went to her house to speak about the things I had told her. First she said to her father, then to her mother and finally to her brother, that I was from another planet called Orion, that was a billion kilometer distance of Earth and that I was so ashamed because I have been his boyfriend since I have came to Earth. My confession caused a disaster in the life of her and her family, and they called the police to take me out of the planet or  arrested, so that I can't see her again. The police caught me, when I was peacefully in my room, and put me covered with something, in a car. After they caught me I think they brought me to the Area 57, were the police do experiments. Since then I live in Area 57, and this is my diary life. I don't now when I and going to be free, for going to my planet. ",23.0
723," 13th June 2000 Dear Helen Ryan, First of all, I would like to thank you and your organisation for giving me this opportunity. I've just received your letter this morning. I am very happy an exciting about it. I can only travel during July because I have many A-levels examinations to take during June. I would prefer staying in a tent because I haven't done it before and I would like to give it a go. I also would like to chose basketball and surfing as two activities to do while I am at the Camp. I am very keen on basketball. I am a captain of  school's basketball team and we have won many competitions. However, my surfing skill is very average as I have only been surfing for three months. There are two questions I would like to ask. First question is how many and what type of clothes do I have to take with me? Another question is how much money do I have to take with me (roughly)? I am really looking forward to take part at Camp California. Yours sincerely, Duangkamol (Denis) Saowaluk  [SEP]  13th June 2000 Dear Kim, How are you? I am fine. Remember I have told you that I have been selected to help at a pop concert of a local band? Well, it turned out really well and everybody had a great time. It was last month that I was selected. I had to help the director writing a script of the concert and design the background of the stage. I have also been told that they were going to make a music video from that concert, so I tried as well as I could. I didn't get involved that much in writing a script because it was very hard and the director wrote most of it but the main idea of the background of the stage was my, and I am very proud of it. Everything has been finally planed two days before the concert. On Saturday night, the concert began. Everything went really well, the music was great and the fans were loving it. When they've finished singing the last song I was surprice when they called me up on the stage and said thank you to me in front of hundreds of people. I am sure that I'll never forget that moment. Love, ",34.0
920," Dear Mrs. Ryan Thank you for your letter which I have just received this morning. I am really appreciated to hear that I have won first prize in the competition - two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. I am writing this letter to inform you more information about myself. I would like to travel only in July because I will have a summer holiday for 2 months at that time. I would prefer the accommodation at Camp California in tents because it would be nice to spend the time living in tents with a nice environment and fresh air. Also I would like to do two activities while I am at the Camp which are swimming and photography. Photography is quite interesting for me to take a photograph in the place where I have never been to . Swimming is quite  nice activity to relax and work out. It is really enjoyable to keep my body fit and healthy by swimming. Anyway, I would like to know that how many people are joining at this Camp. Could you please tell me about the clothes I should take? I am looking forward to hearing from you as soon as possible. Yours sincerely Boonsri Thanasukolwit.  [SEP]  Dear Kim Thanks for your last letter. I'm really sorry, it's taken me so long to reply. How are you doing? I hope that you can get on well with your roommate. Anyway, I enjoyed helping at a pop concert last month. I and my friend - Emma, we helped to paint the scence of the background on the stage. As you known, I like drawing and painting when I have a free time so that  why I chose to paint the scence of the background. I really enjoyed painting it and it looked very nice. And I particularly liked the experience that I helped to screen and paint a picture of ""Bon Jovi"" on every T-shirts which are given to the audiences. I felt that it was a great time in my life. However, I told my teacher that I am willing to give a hand next time. Are you willing to give a hand next time? If you are, I'll tell you  in advance. I must stop writing now as I have a lot of homework to do. Best wishes ",33.0
180," Dear Sir, I'd like to explain  you the problems I have had when I went to the theatre. The main problem I had was  the actor, because he wasn't Danny Brook. Although Tina Truelove was there, I went to the theatre to see Danny Brook. Another problem I had was  the time . I was going to begin at 19.30 but It began at 20.15 and the problem was that It was raining. I'd like to explain too that I didn't see that you made  discounts to no one. I was queuing for a long time and I didn't see it . And I went with a lot of friends and we didn't have any discount. Another question is that in the advertisement you advised we could visit your restaurant but as it was closed we couldn't do it. And we were very hungry after being three hours in the theatre. And that are all  problems I found. And, because of these faults, I'd like to have my money back. If you don't mind, of course. Yours,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. I met Pat when we were children. We went at the same school and  at the same class. I liked a boy who was in the same class. I told her that and she assured me that she wouldn't say it to him. When we finished  our primary school we went at the same secundary school too, but we were in different classes. We went out every weekends. And when we finished  the secundary school, I decided go to a foreign University. I spend five years there, although I came  all summers and we continued going out as we did before. When I finished I return to my city to find a job. A day, Pat told me that we was talking with this boy and that he told her that I like him and immediately she told him that he liked me too. A week after that I found him in a coffee and he asked me if I would like to be his girlfriend and I accepted. Now, five years later we are going to get married. ",26.0
429," Dear Sir or Madame, I am writing to you to complate about the show ""Over the Rainbow"" at your theatre ""The Circle Theatre"". I am deeply disapointed with the service and the unrealiable notice, at your theartre. I've attened your shown on one of the evening, during my stay in London. In your advertisement you've mention ""Danny Brook"" would be starring and as it turned out it was a different Danny Brook. I am very disapointed by this. You also mention that your show would starts at 19.30 but to my knowleage it started at 20:15 and that is fourty-five minutes of waiting. It also mention other services would be availalde to the adicne. For Example there were no discounts available and the theatre restaurant were closed after the show, when it was mean to be open after the show acording to the advertisement but  was closed dure to the delay of the preformane. Lastly your advertisement mention clearly that this would be ""Your perfect evening out!"" but sadly it was a real waste of time for me. And I would like a refun, You have wasted my evening and money. I hope to hear from you soon. Your faithfully, (Rumgopol Rinsook).  [SEP]  For the past 100 year, fashion has change a great deal. Now a day clothes is designed to be more comfortable. You can just ""pop down the road"" and go shopping. Material and coloures of your cloths has changed since the early 1900's to 2000. Synethetic was created by scientis. Clothes are now mass producted and desing by desingers. Desingres are unique in the way but their desings are some times more, a pirce of art and not for realistic perposoe. It is hard to imageine what people would were in 100 years time, because since the 1900's clothes have reduce into smaller item and more preticle. May be it would contine reduceing in 100 years to come. Scinetis might discover a new way to make clothes more fixalde. It could be that you would carry a small round box. It would provide you with a new type of material to cover you body and you can chosse what you want to wear by pressing bottons. This would be very easy to mantage but that  mean no  shopping for girls. It would be scarly to live in the new 100 years, but it would be interesting to see what will happen. Hopefully it wouldn't be verybody walking around neaked. ",28.0
1174," Dear Maria, I'm so happy to help you for this international student conference. I'm afraid for Richard. Could you please tell him my best wishes of  health? I'm sure  you can perfectly replace it to lead your group. At first, you should know that you are booked into the Palace Hotel that is one of the best in the town. The access to the conference place is very easy. First of all, you must walk down to the Central Street until you arrive at the bus stop, then you take the bus number two that goes directly to the college. After the conference, there is a great party that is organised by friends. It starts at twenty o'clock  until the end of the night, so be ready! There is no special thema for the wearing style but it should be more fun if you wear something crazy... Finally, I propose you to go to the new college swimmingpool on the last day   afternoon. Every body will go there. I hope you will have fun! Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Hello, I will give you some informations on the yverdon's castle. This building is one of the oldest that stays in the landscape of the town. I think its important to see it when you come there because it shows us how the town had been developped around it since its creation. Those days, the castle is being remade, so there is a lot of construction engines around it. That's not a big problem because there is a complete museum in it where you can see old pictures of the castle during the centuries. There is a lot of old items that were in the King's family. You should have probably heard about the mummy who sleeps there for about two thousand years... You can see it in the dungeon. So you can visit everywhere you want with or without a guide. I hope you will enjoy the visit and I wish you a nice holliday in Yverdon. Best regards, ",27.00
412," 17/6/00 Dear Sir/Madam I had a vary dissappointing evining last saturday. I had everythig planned, I and my family where coming to whatch your show and then have a decent meal at your theatre restaurant but it was disasterous. Firstly there was no available discount, as you said  on your advertisement so even my 6 year old son was charged  adult price. Then everything was going well untill the show didn't start! Supposedly it was to start at 19:30 well it didn't, it started 45 minutes late, at exactly 20:15. And By the way may I ask you how up to date your leaflets are because in spite of the ad vert saying the staring actor was Danny Brook, well it wasn't. It was an other actor  I had never heard of. That was a dissapointment for my whole family, infact all the viewers where very dissappointed. Anyway the show was nowhere as good as it was mentioned to be and it was definately worse than I had expected it to be, I didn't enjoy it at all so I was relying on the food to fill me up and relieve some of my stress. So as soon as the show was over we walked out and followed all the signs for about 5 minutes desparately searching for your restaurants our stomaches rumbling for food. Finally we found the place. The location is far too far away and, what do you know, the place is closed for restoration, and it has been for two weeks! And your booking staff didn't know this obviously as they took our booking, with no problems whatsoever. they even gave us a table number. What kind of an organasation do you call this, sir/madam? You don't understand how dissappointed and angry I was that night. I was expecting a perfect night out but I came face to face with a total nightmare. And I am demanding a refund. Thankyou for your time and attention Yours Sincerely.   [SEP]  The Revealed Secret Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. In fact he was one of the main busybodies of his neighborhood and his school so not alot of people in his school liked him. this was a vary bad thing about Pat's school and also for Pat. Another bad thing about this school was that there where different types of students that formed groups. Some where just friend groups but others took it seriously, maby just a bit too seriously, they gave themselves names and acted as gangs rather than just groups of friends, and started picking on younger people, or mempers of other gang, trying to start fights with them. This whent on and on, got more and more serious but it was so secret that  teachers didn't notice. One day one of those groups decided to have a party and although Pat wasn't in their group they invited him too but told him very strictly to keep it a secret especially from the other groups. But Pat was so exited that he forgot all about the secret and told all of his best mates. and the word spread like wildfire and by the end of the day virtually everyone knew about this party. But luckily for Pat the word did not return to the group having the party. Everyone in the year was anoyed, but not with Pat, oh, no! With the group having the party. No one could do anything about it. exept a few phcyco groups, some of the more serious ones decided to raid this party, just for the fun and meannes of it. That night the party commenced. Everyone was enjoying themselves exept Pat who had heard about the raid. So he was thinking up an excuse to go home early. But no excuses where working. Everyone was drunk and they simply would not let him go. Time was ticking away. he new the attack was coming anyminute. now, The time had come the who groups had comdined their forces and where ready to strike. They had water bombs and water pistols at the ready. they started charging down the field towards the fire and once in range everyone thew their balloon as far as they could. they all exploded with loud splashes. The group having the party thought this was a serious attack and started throwing back stones and shooting every one wit BB guns. Lots of People wher injured and even more where suspended the next day at school, when the Headmaster found out what had happened. Pat recieved no punishment at all and he wasn't blamed for anything by his teachers or friends. But he felt awfull because he new that all this had happened because of him. ",31.0
401," Dear Sir. I'm sorry to say it but your musical show was very disappointing to me. I was very disappointed. Lot of things that you have written at the advertisement are not true. You writer that the actor was going to be Danny Brook but he wasn't there. A different actor was played and this was very disappointing to everyone. Also the show did not start at half past seven o'clock as it was said but at eight and fifteen o'clock. Everyone get bored  until the show start. About the discount that we are going to have. Why it does not make to us? I am also wondering why you told us to visit your theatre restaurant after the show. as it was closed. Everyone after the show run to take a good seat at the restaurant but everyone  disappointed when they see the sight which said ""Close for today"". That evening wasn't my perfect and I have to say that I want my money back because the show was a disaster. I'm really sorry I am saying this but  is the true. I am hoping that you will not make such mistakes again. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Pat is a friend of mine and we are friends for almost a year. She is a very good girl and she can deal with every promblem she has. It was Saturday when I called her and told her to go for a walk at the park, which was not very far away from our houses. I had never told her a secret before but this time, I was going to tell her. The secret was about our friend Maria who was very kind with everyone I told her that I have heard that Maria had concern. Pat told me that she would not told that to anyone but the other day I learnt that all the school had known about Maria. I was sure that  was Pat who told it to everyone. After that I had an argument with Pat and then she told me that she said it only to one person. I was very sad with what Pat do and I didn't speak to her for a long time. But now we are friends again but I will never say to her a secret  in my whole life. ",24.0

Firstly I want to congratualate you for the festival. It was a great idea. However there were things that I didn't like. You said that stars and artists would come from around the world but there was only starts from six major countries. I suggest you to increase this number for the next year. By this way we can meet other stars and artists, see different cultures. Another thing that I will point on is, the concert halls are too small. Some people couldn't enter the hall and they missed the concerts. There were some plays and films. They were excellent so can you show more plays next year?  Last thing that I will say is ""one reasonably-priced weekend ticket"". It was  very good idea. I hope you will make the same thing next year. These are the my suggestions. I hope you will listen  my suggestions. This will make the festival better. I hope we will meet next year in the festival.  Sincerely  [SEP]  16.12.2000 Dear Emily, I'm glad to see your letter. I'm fine thanks and my parents are also good. How are you and your parent? I' hope they are both well. I have a suprise for you. I will go to  this summer. May be we can meet there... You asked some questions about  rules in school and homes Let me answer this question. In schools we aren't allowed to speak in classes. Also we must go to school by our uniforms. However we are allowed to eat,  drink during the breaks. All the time we must be kind to our friends and teachers. We mustn't forget the books for the classes. These are the rules in school. In our home there are some rules too! I must be in home untill 11pm. I am not allowed to listen  high volume music at home. I must be kind to my brother and my parents. When the guests come to our home, I must be clear. Other things are allowed to me. I want to change  school uniform rule so everybody can wear what they want.  Other rules are O.K. I want to hear some rules from you. Next time write the letter quick! I don't want to wait another 2 months. I'm waiting for your next letter. Take care and be careful not to break any rules.

Secondly, I prefer to stay in a tent. I have stayed in  tents a few times and I have not had any problems. About the activities that I can do at the camp, I chose to practise Basketball, which is my favourite sport, because I want to do some excersise while I am on vacation. I also chose Fotography because it is one of my hobbies. I am very good at both activities because I have practised them all my life. I would like to ask you a couple of things about the prize I have won. Firstly, what kind of clothes  I have to take to the camp, clothes for hot or cold weather?. I also wanted to know if I have to take some money to buy souvenirs and food or that will be paid for me, too? Those are all my questions. I am looking forward  receiving your reply.

That wasn't difficult because everybody wanted to go. The day of the concert we helped to clean the place where the concert was performed and to have everything in order so the concert could be a succes, which it was. What I particularly liked about this experience was meeting my favourite pop group and talk with them about their lifes as  a pop group.

678," Dear Helen: I've recived your letter and I am pleased to have won because I needed some days to relax myself and to leave the city, which is very extressing. I only can travel on July because I am working in an office and I must ask my boss for a holiday and it's the mounth he can give me , so I hope it isn't a problem for you. To spend the two weeks I would prefer to live in  tents, that's in my opinion a way to be nearer the enviroment and the animals, although I don't mind living in log cabins. In spite of liking all the sports you wrote  in your letter I am only good at climbing and sailing, because I am used to practise them with my father since I was a child. I have got a doubt, it is not very important, but I would like to know if I need any money or  all is payed , the kind of clothes I should wear, if the weather is good or bad... and all the extra information you can send me. Thank you very much for the prize. Yours faithfully. Eliza Vasquez.  [SEP]  Why  people like so much go shopping? In my opinion the majority of the people that go shopping are women who must buy food and other kind of things for her family, so for them, shopping is a very boring activity that is repeated everyday and that drive them crazy when they have to choose the best product and the cheapest price to save some money. Othrewise, there are people who think the opposite; such as: children, teenagers, men; but not always, because they go to buy hardly ever, only when they need clothes or something for their job or school. In that way shopping can be as  funny as you want, although if you do it very often, it will be as an obligation in the future. To sum up, all you make in small cuantities is good and funny, but don't encrease them if you don't want to feel uncomfortable. ",28.0
208," Dear Sir/Madam, Recently I had a week's holiday in London. During my stay I went to The Circle Theatre to see ""Over the rainbow"", the ""London's newest and best musical show."" I have to admit that  was my great mistake. Never before had I  such a disappointing evening. First of all, there was an old, ugly, and unknown actor in the main part instead of  brilliant Danny Brook! To make matters worse, the show started at 20.15, although the advertisement was saying it would begin at 19.30. Moreover, there weren't any discounts, and I had to pay much more for my ticket than I had expected. And on the top of everything your theatre restaurant was closed because of the waiters' strike, so I had to look for another place to have a snack. You can imagine how upset I am at having suffered such discomfort and disappointment. It wasn't a ""perfect evening out"" at all! That is why I expect at least half the ticket price back. I hope you will give this matter your immediate consideration. Otherwise I'll have to apply to  court for aid. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Fashion of the Future. What will clothes be like 100 years from now? This question is not simple to answer. On the one hand, science and technology have been developing rapidly, and God knows what new materials will be invented in  future. We probably will be wearing dresses made of synthetic artificial cloth in 2100. Of course, those new material won't be so harmful for our health as today's nylon and other things like that. On the other hand, people tend to wear natural clothes today, made of cotton, wool . This tendency may result in turning down synthetics at all. And it is even more difficul to predict how the clothes of the future will look like. People's  fantasy is enormous. Anyway, we'll give up wearing fur coats as it is cruel and uncivilised. ",30.0
811," Dear Madam Helen Ryan, I have received your letter yesterday. I really thanks  for your organisation has given me the opportunities to go abroad U.S.A. The date that I would like to travel, that will be nice to go on  1st of July. Because my summer holidays break is start at  end of June. And I need  few days to prepare my stuff. Regarding to the accommodation, I would prefer to stay in tents more than log carbins because I have a lot of experiences of built up my own tents. When I was in highschool I used to be a member of the campfire. The activities that you have listed forms. Some of the them I  really interested in it, especially painting. Since I was young, my dad he alway took me out to have live drawings, so now it became  my hobbies. And I think, it is nice to draw the beautiful landscapes of the place. Beside drawings, swimming is my favourite as well. When I was in highschool, I have joined in the swimming club. And I also participated in a few swimming competition. Although I'm not the best, but I have a lot of confident in it. At last  some of things I need to clarify, that is, what type of clothes and  money do I need to prepared. Thanks again.  [SEP]  I agree! Sometimes shopping is not always enjoyable. For most of the people might think, why would I say that, because shopping is a very good entertainment especially for female, as me. For frank, I like to shopping. Of course not because of buying things. I like to have window shopping that is good to go arround the shopping area. It would help you  up to the date. What fashion is hit now. But, when during any peak season, like Christmas, holidays or even during weekends. Then I can say I'm definatly doesn't feel any enjoyable. Because of the crowd. For me I think, it is not shopping that is kind of suffering. Especially, queue up for twenty minutes for just paying the money or waiting for the salesgirl getting your the right size of clothes.

AND FOR SEEING IT MY FAMILY HAD A VERY DISAPPOINTING EVENING AND SO DID I FOR IT YOU CAN READ BELOW MY POINT OF VIEW ABOUT IT.

ALTHOUGH IT MAY BE BAD BECAUSE WE NEEDN'T TO GO OUT FOR DOING THE MAIN THINGS AND FOR IT WE DON'T KNOW NEW PEOPLE AND WITH THE TIME WE HAVE LESS CONTACT WITH THE PEOPLE.

However, it was different from the fact. I had a very disappointing evening. Firstly, Danny Brook did not act as you had said. A different actor acted in stead of him. it was disappointing. Secondly Discounts did not availabe. Even though I brought  discount taken which I was given by  travel agency. What's more, the theatre reastaurant had been closed, when the show finished. Because the show started  20:15. It should have started at 19:30 as you said at  advertisement, or you should not have closed  before the show finished. It was not  perfect evening whatoever.

1001," Dear Mrs Ryan, I am writing to answer to your letter in which you told me I won first prize in our competetion, which is two weeks , I was very happy with this result since I did not think I could win. First of all I would like to tell you that I will be able to travel only in July because in the other months I will be too busy with my work. In the second place I add that I would prefer an accomodation in a tent, even though it is not very comfortable, because I want to put myself to the test by living in a condition I am not used to. Besides this, in connexion with the activities we will have the chance to do, I would like to inform you that I choose swimming and tennis because I am quite good at both, especially at tennis. In addition to this I would like to ask you which kind of clothes and how much money it is necessary to have, since I am undecided about it not knowing the cost of life in California. I look forward to hearing from you soon, Yours Sincerely, Marino Rizzo  [SEP]  The aim of this report is to suggest which activities of our daily life at school shoud be filmed to give the other students the idea of what we usually do not only during the lessons but also the rest of the time. Most of the students agree in saying that  two are the main features of our daily life at school which should be filmed: it would be very funny to dwell on us working and speaking together without the help of the teacher to show our efforts and sometimes successful and sometimes ridiculous and also to film some amusing moments we spent waiting for the teacher. A little percentage, on the contrary, said it would be very useful to film the teacher when she is explaining us something important, to give the idea of the real life in our classroom. which is the most.

474," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to you because I am really dissapointed bout ""Over the Rainbow"" which I saw the other day in my stay in London which your company organized. I put off everything to watch this performance but everything that was written in your advertisement wasn't true at all. In your advertisement  said the show will start at 19:30 however it began at 20:15. I can understand that a musical show has to be prepared and it takes time. Even though, I can't understand  the actor of this play Danny Brook and Tina Truelove doesn't appeared in the play and there was another actor instead of Danny Brook. After all this I wanted to make my evening pleasant however for my surprise the theatre restaurant was closed because  some problems of sanitary. I explained to you every detail about what happened in the musical show and I want you refund my money and send to me an apology for what happenned there. I hope hear from you  sooner as possible and thanks for understand my situation. Yours fainthfully Phat Cheung  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed your daily life? Many years ago human beings or whatever we  called was another animal species but when they tried to use rocks to make a fire we changed everything. Modern technology changed our lifes in many ways, when I have to wake up earlier I use my alarm clock, if I have to wash my teeth I use my toothbrush with a little of toothpaste. I use my desk to study which was made with trees cut down and emsamblish by machines more powerful than handwork. Even though, this is not enough  the technology created a better way of communication, first there were letters, after telephones and now we can write letters and receive them through  internet. It is not necessary to imagine things, you can travel all around  just making a click with your mouse and you are there. If I am hungry I open the refrigerator and take foods and cook it with a microwave. When I have a headache I ate pills, made by technology. I think everything round us is thanks for technology but we can't forget that this things was made by us. The human being. Everything has advantages and disadvantages but the most important thing is how we use it. If we creates guns to protect our homes, others will use it to steal our homes,  take advantage from the indefense people. However, the technology never stops, we always search  new things because we are made to compete, discover, think  things which we don't know. ",22.0
157," To. Mr or Mrs Manager of Circle Theatre. Hi. My name is Taeron Jon. And I would like to inform you that something is not right and  unfair about your theatre. I recently had a week's holiday in London. During I stay I went to your theatre to see a musical show and unfortunatly I had a very disappointing evening. The advertisement that you distributed through all the magazines wee totally untrue. Which so called ""Rip off"". First of all you said Danny Brook is in the play but  different actor was in the roll. It was just unbelievably disappointing because the reason I mean  main reason which made me to go was to see Danny Brook. Secondly about the time. If it's delayed you should have told us before. Not waiting there for almost 1 hour doing nothing. Due to  late start it finished at 1 AM and my taxi which I booked just left so I had to wait out side for another hour to get a taxi. It was freezing out side and I got  horrible cold for that. lastly about the ticket  advertisment saids 'Discouts Available' but no way I had to pad  full £ 20.00 and  restaurant was closed because of rebuilding  something. How ever the point that it am trying to say is  you just ruined my hoilday. For me, It's not easy to have  holiday and your play just blew my precious time away. Let me make it clear, you blew my time and money. I don't thing your play worth £ 20.00. Your advertisment was un fair. As you are a manager, you have resposbillity  to justify this problem. and I have  right to get a fair treatment as a costomer. So therefore I would like you to pay some money back. I am not asking for full payment but minimum 50%  that it paid for nothing but the disappoint. Thank you. Yours Taeron Jon  [SEP]  Fashion of the future. Fashion, what is fashion? Popular design of cloths. In  particular time? Maybe. But I say fashion is Artistic insperation which  expressed by fabric and all sort of material. In some way, fashion is combined with science as well. Now a days fashion play  big roll in our daily life. Million kinds of fashion magazines and News paper tells you how much people are interested in fashion. What about after 100 years? I believe we'll be more into fashionable stuffs. As I said before, fashion is somehow influenced by science and insperations that we get from all sort of enviroment. Development of science produce new materials like water proof or fire proof fabrics. For example Castum of Astronuts. These days we are very intrested in space and  millenium and things and many designers  showed millenium looks recently. But we don't wear them. Frankly we can't because we think it's too odd or strange. But what about 100 year later? I expect human being'll live in the other planets and trevel around under  sea. I think people'll wear those spacy and Ciber looking cloth after a centry. What do you think? Can you imagin you and your friends going   picnic to the Moon with  silvery skirt with Astronut boots with fire coming out at the bottom of your boots? It could be more facinating. Endless imagination and development of technology will lead us to future fashion. ",22.0
238," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to you after visiting your theatre. Frankly speaking, I was very disappointed after my visit. I was displeased from the very beginning, because I expected to get a discount as I'm a student. According to your advertisment I could have one but in reality there were no discounts at all. But nevertheless I decided to go to your show. The show started t 20.15 instead of 19.30. I had to wait in  overcrowded hall. When finally the show had started I found out that Danny Brook was replaced by another actor. One of the reasons for my visiting your show was Danny Brook's participance. So, you could understand how disappointed I was. To make matters worse the restaurant which was mentioned in your advertisment was closed. So I hadn't such  perfect evening, as was promised in your advertisment. In fact there were a lot of mistakes in your advertisment and I would be gratefull if you could give me back a part of my money. I'm looking forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed your daily life? In my opinion, modern technologies play the important role in people's life. I think that at present the most important technologies are computer and Internet technologies. Both computer and  Internet influence people's life. I have to use  computer every day. It helps me in preparing my homeworks. Firs of all  Internet gives you an access to a great number of different information. On the one hand  Internet is often used for entertaiment, but on the other hand it's also used in different business and education process! With the help of Internet technologies I communicate with other people from all over the world it gives me  chance to improve my English. From my point of view,  Internet can be used in education, because it gives an opportunity to have distant relations between pupils and teachers. Though  Internet has a lot of positive aspects I think you should be careful with it and not to be depended on it. ",27.0
181," Dear Mr. maneger of The Circle Theatre: I'm writing to you to explain some problems about your theatre's show, first I have to say to you that there was a different actor  starring  the act. I expect that starring the act was Danny Brook and there was another man. I'm very disappointed with the hour that the act started. I had been waiting for more than half an hour. About the prize, the paper that I have at home tells that there were discounts availables, if these discounts are true I couldn't use them. When the show had finished I couldn't visit the restaurant of the theatre because it was closed. The reason they gave us, was that they hadn't got any waiters. For all those reasons I give to you, I ask for the money I had payed to you back. In my opinion it wasn't my perfect evening out. I'm sorry if I make any problem to you, but I'm very angry and it was your fault. Thank you for your attention,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. I was fourteen-year-old and I was with my bestfriend, Pat. We were in a private school, that looks like a castle, in London and we had been staying there for two months. Our parents took us there because they wanted that we became good and polite girls. The life in the school was very boring and sometimes we organized games to get funny in there. One day I discovered a secret path in the school, this path went from our bedroom to the director's room. I thought that was  good idea told to Pat because we could use  to look for exams, and then we could pass all of them. When I told to her, she promised to me that she  kept the secret. But in a few days she told the secret to all the class. All our mates wanted to enjoy our fantastic and secret path to look for exams. Then somebody told to a teacher and the teachers went to talk to our parents. They were very angry and disappointed with us. Nowadays, I remember this story like a bad experience.  ",21.0

1034," Dear Mr Robertson Our class is looking forward to going to London next week. The programme which you've organised we find very interesting especially the river trip to Greenwich. Thank you very much for it. There is only one thing that we'd like to change, if you wouldn't mind. We've read an advertisement about  London Fashion and Leisure Show which will take place on Tuesday, March 14 from 10 oo to 19 oo. The latest fashions will be shown there and many useful tips about make-up and hairstyles will be given. According over programme we have a free time on Wednesday, March 15. So we'd like to go to a disco and this fashion show would be a great opportunity for us to learn something about styling. As we are from the small town we don't have any possibility to learn about this. We suggest to visit the Science Museum on Monday after the sightseeing tour by bus. We think we'll find one free hour befor the River trip. It would be a good solution. We hope you are agree with us. Your class  [SEP]  In every country there are the famous people who are in the middle of the public attention. They are always expected to be beautiful, intelligent, good-looking. This is very stressful. That's why it's very important for these people to have a private life without journalists where they can relax and where they don't need to be superstars. To have a private life is the natural desire of everyone and the famous film stars or politicians have a right for it. Otherwise they can get soul problems,  fall in deep depressions. I think that it must be awful to know that you are observed by journalists or other people, your fans for example all 24 hours in a day, and the all things you do in your life are published and the whole world knows who is your friend, where you go shopping, who you love in and who you sleep with. On my opinion this is the worst thing that can ever happen. I think we should have a little bit  respect for the famous people and let them some time for their private life. ",33.00
1070," Dear Mr Robertson. I am writing to express the deserve of all  students in my class to visit the LONDON FASHION AND LEISURE SHOW at  Central Exhibition Hall, on Tuesday 14 March. All  students have seen an advertisement for that and they would like to go to the show. I think that will be  very good programme. especially the part of the Latest Fashions, because  is something which affect the people of all ages today. But also the rest parts of the show seems to be very interesting. Leisure and Sports Wear is very interesting. I think that young people are affected from that in the way they dressed. Make up and Hairstyles are also very important especially For our class, because the most  students of our class are girls. The girls are interesting more than boys, For make up and hairstyle. and they want to know all the latest news about these . I know that for Tuesday 14 March you have already organise the programme which including for  morning a visit to  Science Museum and For  afternoon shopping but we can change that as Follows: Tuesday morning until 15.00 visit to Science Museum Tuesday afternoon from 1600 to 1900 visit to THE LONDON FASHION AND LEISURE SHOW. Thank you very much. I am apologise For any incovenience. and I am waiting for your reply. Yours sincerelly  [SEP]  Famous people, such as politicians and Film stars, deserve to have a private life without journalists Following them all the time. I think that they have  right because, they are also people like me or like you and they should have  private life. Private life is very important to anyone, because your job create you stress and you should rest, charge your batteries For the next day. If journalists  following you step by step  is difficult to have a private life. On the other hand. I believe that Journalists  doing their work, but sometimes they try to impress their boss and  always. Following the Famous people in order to discover something new of their lifes. Another thing is the pressure. From media owners and the difficulty For someone to Find  job in our days. Media owners want to maximize their profits and always press the journalists to Find something new. To conclude journalists should doing their work but without annoyance to the other people. Private life is right to anyone and all we should respect it. ",27.00

Firstly, I would like to start my journey on the second week of July because I will have a 3 weeks holiday in July. I could not travel in June and May because I will have my standard grade exam during these two months. As for the accommodation I would like to stay in a log cabin because I hate sleeping in the tents. I stayed in a tent once when I had my Duke of Edinburgh walk. I felt really uncomfortable in the tent. Secondly, I would like to have a chance to do singing and swimming while I am  the Camp. I am keen on singing and I have won sevral singing competitions at school. I have chosen swimming because it is my favourite sport. I enjoy doing it very much. I note that all accommodation and travel costs are paid for, but does it include my expenses in California? Lastly, I would like to know what the weather in California  likes and which type of clothes I have to bring.

As you know I had a wonderful experience in last month so I am writing to tell you . I was chosen to help at a pop concert by chance in last month. At that time, I was so nervous because I did not know what to do. However, I was excited to meet lots of people and the pop star, Kelly Chen. When I first entred the concert hall, I was given a pass for working here. There were five other students, like me, who were waiting to help. We were sitting at the back of the concert hall and chatting with each other. I found that they were all Kelly's fans. We were told that we were responsible for decorating the hall. There were lots of decorations and I had to put the decorations to the right place. It was a tiring work because I had to run from place to place for hanging the decorations. After I had finished my work, I saw Kelly Chen walking into the concert hall. She smiled at me and said thank you to me. I was very happy at that time and I thought it was the happiest moment that I ever had. At last, the concert was started. There were many people at the show and I was sitting on a good seat to watch the concert. I had a really good time in this experience because I could meet my favourite singer. Could you tell me what your happiest moment is? I look forward to hearing from you. Your faithfully ",36.0

If it would be possible I wish I travel in July because I have planned my holidays this month at work and I would not be able to remove them for accommodation, I would choice the log cabin, I am not very fond of ""adventure"", that is why tents are not for me. I expect that these two weeks will be as a big rest. Third, you need to know which sport I want to to practise. I would choice photography and tennis. In photography, I am just a novice, nevertheless I have got a suitable camera... (I guess that you shouldn't borrow some! About tennis, I play for eight years and I am used to sit for competition.

In order to strike people who will watch the film, we could record  student drawing on the big drawing tables. I would do the same for thermodynamics. Nevertheless, we should not forget the extra-life school. We have to show sports at school and all  activities that we are offered. There are not only the brain which should be trained. Futur students could appreciate to come if they could still practise their sport.

1083," Dear Mr Robertson, I'm writting this letter giving some opinions about the three days that the class will spend in London. I see that you has already organised the programme. However, the students in my class have seen an advertisement for ""the London Fashion and Leisure Show"" and they would all like to go to the show. So I'm writting this letter, asking, if you can change the programme. The London Fashion and Leisure show is a special event that is realized once a year, there are the latest Fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and hair styles, all things that a young people wants to see. There is a great opportunity to go there because the students need not pay anyting. I'm suggesting how  programme could be changed. The fashion  starts at 10:00 am and ends at 19:00 p.m. and will be realized on 14 March, so we can change the shopping with this event that is realized in the afternoon, and put the shopping at night. There will be a great success! Your sincerely, X teacher.  [SEP]  The Dangerous Mission. ""It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it""... That was my situation at the moment. The story had began two days before... ""The Honorable men's group"", Dick, Nick and I, has formed this group. Our mission was, stealing the women's panties, I think that it was very stupid, but it was the most difficult thing that the humanity can do. It prove our bravura to be a man. Our first chalenge was stealing Dick's girlfriend's pantie, but it failed. And she broke up the relationship with Dick and we had a conclusion that stealing panties from young girls was very difficult. So we tried to stole adult's panties. Nick and Dick could prove their bravure stealing from their mother's panties. I was the only one that couldn't stole any panties. So I decided to go to my grand mother's house and try to steal some panties. But she was a very angry woman. ""It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it"", to prove my bravure to all. I had quickly, entered in my grandmother's room and started to get some panties. I was very nervous that I forgot my shoes. Next day my Grand mother come and she gave my shoes to my mother. That was the most dangerous mission of my life. ",22.00
79,"  Dear Ms Clark, I had recently spent two days at your annual international arts festival. It was the first time I went and I was very pleased to go. I, actually, wasn't disappointed. However I would like to give my opinion about the festival. First of all, I congratulate you on making this kind of event. It was such a good success that some people weren't able to have tickets! You should increase the number of places you give. Therefore, you could invite artists from around the world  not only from six countries: it would be more pleasant. Although I am keen on classical music, I found some concerts halled too small. I was wondering if you could improve that? Also, there were  interesting films but not enough. Perhaps, you could possibly meet some producers, who come from others countries in order to show different cultures. Besides, to pay one reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events is excellent because we could see all that we wanted without paying each time. Finally I suggest to invite important scientists like Hubert Reeves or Aaroun Tazief so as to inform the public about the new technologies or sciences because it also  a kind of art! I look forward to seeing the next festival! Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Laurel, Thank you for your recent letter. I couldn't write sooner because I was very busy last week. I see you are interested in hearing about school rules in France and also about what I am allowed  or not to do at home. To begin with the wchool rules we have in fact some important ones. Firstly, when you arrive late at your lesson, you have to apologize you to your teacher. Also when you have forgotten to do your homeworks. What's more, you had better have done them if you would have to go to the blackboard! Although our library is very large, we mustn't make  noise in order not to disturb the students, who work. It may be like that in your library, may not  it? I consider the school rules are good: we should respect the teachers and people who need to work. At home, I have to look after my two little brothers when my parent's are here. If I don't make the cooking, I will have to do the washing up. I am sometimes allowed to watch the television when I have finished my homeworks. Fortunately I can play  violin when I want even if I haven't done my homework. It is what I like most. I don't really want to change that, I think it is just like this. I hope this answer satisfies you. I look forward to receiving your next letter! Best wishes ",31.00
144," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to you to complain about the unexpected evening I had when I went to see the musical show ""Over the rainbow"" in your theatre. First of all, the time for the second session was meant to be at 19.30, but somehow it began at 20.15, which was a 45 minutes delay. I was also expecting to see the actor Danny Brook performing, but a different actor did, who did not perform as well as Danny Brook does. This was another disappointing thing of that evening. But my complain does not finish here. It was of my understanding that discounts were available on the tickets, as the advertisement showed, but there were no discounts. And what is more, I could not go to the restaurant after the show, as it was closed because the main chef was ill and could not come to work. Definetely, it was not my perfect evening at all and under these circumstances I really believe you should give me my money back. Looking forward to hearing from you, Alessandra Lane.  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. As soon as she arrived home, she phoned her best friend Sue and told her everything, all details included. She also told her not to tell anybody about it because it was a secret. The thing was that Mary couldn't resist the secrecy and phoned her cousin, who also studied in our school. She was the director of the school newspaper and Mary didn't tell her it was a secret, so on monday at 9 a.m. MY SECRET was published in the school paper and at the end of the day, eventually everybody had read the ""news"". I didn't know it was published as I didn't read the paper and no one told me anything, either. But I soon knew it because when I went to the school canteen everybody was staring at me and whispering to eachother. At first I didn't realise what was happening, but then a friend of mine told me that everyone knew that I was going out with the most popular boy in the school and that we had kissed eachother in the park last friday. Suddenly my face went all red and I ran towards the toilet. I had never felt so embarrassed and miserable in my life, but luckily next day almost everybody forgot about it. That day I swore to myself that I would never trust anybody again. ",39.0

First of all I would like to travel on July because I will I have finished my exams by the end of June. I will not be able to travel on August because I have found a job for that month. Secondly I would prefer to be accommodate in  log cabins. When I was a child I was affraid of all these little insects that they live in the ground and this fear still remain till now. I also think that the log cabin will be much more confortable than the tent. asketball and swimming are the two activities I have chosen.

I didn't have to do something very difficult. I was only responsable for the property of the back stages. But if anyone was been asking for some help I was always there. The most exciting  about this experience was to meet all these well-known people. I was shocked and terrified the firt time I saw them, but the truth is that they are men like us. They have a very simple life and behavior when they weren't on the scene If I have the opportunity next month I really want to go back. I will definitely apply for a place. Love Kelly. ",25.0
146," Dear Sir, I'm writing to complain for the musical show ""Over the Rainbow"". I've been recently seeing  in your theatre during my week's holiday in London  I must say I had a very disappointing evening! I was sure this was the London's newest and best musical show  I  had ever seen because of the good publicity you made  in your advertisement, but I thought completely wrong! Firstly, the play started nearly an hour later as I expected! If the spectacle has been beautiful, I would have been quite pleased to wait. Then, I had read that there would have been discounts available, but it wasn't true! So it's better not to write anything if you don't make it  true then. Finally, I hoped that, after these incidents, I would enjoy myself, but there was another change of  programme:  starring! The main actor, Danny Brook, was changed and the one who played his part wasn't as good as I expected. Finished the show, I went to your theatre restaurant, but it was closed and this hasn't been said before. Moreover, I was shocked by the reason for which it was closed: the chef went away after he received a phone call! For all these reason, I want to ask for my money back and I hope to hear from you soon! A suggestion? Organize better your shows and do not exagerate with publicity! Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  There would be many things to say about . Technology is a wide field which increases very quickly. It's creating an artificial world, where everything is electronic and fast. I'm not sure if I must say  technology has changed our life in  positive  or not. Certainly, thanks to it, we can do things today that were impossible a few centuries ago. Nowadays, we  make a phone call with an astonish rapidity, instead at my grandparents' time it took one month or more to have  contact with people abroad, because the only means of communication was the post and its service was very slow! When appeared the first car, it was already a great success. Before that, people travelled by horse or worse. Fortunately today everyone can take an aeroplane and go to America, Australia or wherever else he wants! What can I say about the television? It allows us to keep connections with the other states of the world, improves our knowledge, offers us news, advises us about events which happened or will happen. In the not very far 1914, parent sent their sons in war and it was very difficult to know if they were still alive or dead! It's terrible! Despite this, I'm convinced all this progress caused some damages at the community, not only phisically. We pay less attention to our life, to those things which give us happiness, that aren't money, success, power. We became passive people, we follow the same routine every day and we live in a society where rules are strongly fixed. I think everyone should live his own life how he wants to live it and make him known for who he is, not for his money, but for his abilities, his good habits, his personality. Finally, everyone should decrease his own life's rythm. ",29.0
622," Dear Mrs. Ryan, I have just received your letter and I would like to thank you about the two weeks in California I won in the competition. California has always been in my dreams. I will be leaving university in a few month's time but  is in my plans to continue my studied at another University trying to do a master of two years. Having decided to take a month off between University and course it would be great to have my holidays from 1st to 15th July. I have always wanted to spend my holidays in  tent but my father has never given me the permission, and this would be an ideal opportunity for me to learn about camp life. I am a good swimmer and also well at golf (handicap twelve) I took a certificate as Teachear in both of them six years ago before I went to ""CROARA GOLF"" in Milan where I organised  evening's entertainment for  customers. I hope that you can let me know, before I will live, how many degrees there will be so that I cannot make a mistake choosing my clothes and how much aproximately I will spend in money. I look forward to reading from you. Please do not hesitate to contact me at (0297) 8245123 in case of need. Yours sincerely, Bonfilia Conti  [SEP]  I do not agree that it is preferable to phone at the shop and give them a list of items you need instead of going to the shop and choose whatever you want. First of all, I belive that if someone has time to go to the shop has the possibility. ",25.0
297," Dear Sir Owing to the bad organisation of the last play that was played in your theatre those last weeks I want to explain you  some incorrect information that I found in your advertisement and as a result of it, all the problems that I had . First of all, I think if you go to a play and you are watching to see your favourite actor playing a good play and then  appears a silly one, who doesn't know what to do, it is disappoint at all. Secondly, all the spectators were waiting  the begining of the play at 19.30 and it started at 20.15 then I would like to know why do you say one time in the advertisement  why do you do what you want. Another thing that I want to know is why you didn't do any discount if it was showed in the advertisement. Maybe, I could be a good way to get spectators but I'm going to comunicate that to my travel office. When the play was finished I was looking for your theatre restaurant but it was closed because like on the paper that was on the door was writen, it was too late. I think, that it wasn't my perfect evening out so I wait to be payed back. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets so she lost all her school friends. All started when she was fifteen, when  started a new course on the institute and met some girls that passed the time they would became her friends. Three years passed and like is normal between friends, she knew a lot of things about them like her friends knew a lot about her When it was time to do the final exam, she became ill and she couldn't do it so  teachers decided to allow her to pass the course because she had a lot of good marks but on the other hand the principal desagreeded with it and didn't give the permision to pass her. She had to repeat that course and all her friends passed and like is usuall  girls from the last course became popular. Pat, to win her new classemates' friendship tell all what she knew about her friends and owing to what Pat said, her friends broke they friendship with Pat because their popularity was damaged. Pat's classmates made the same and Pat finished alone. ",23.0
1141," Dear Mrs Brown, I am writing in connection with a surprise birthday party for your husband, Mr. Brown. We are writing to invite you and to give you some information about the party. All our class love Mr Brown very much, so we decided to organise a surprise party for him. The party in on Tuesday 16 of June. You should come on 3 pm in  college Canteen. We have bought some snaks to eat and three students will sing for him, also. Besides this, we have invited all  other teachers and the Principal of our school. Of course all the class will take party to this party. Furthermore, we don't know what present buying for him. So we would appreciate  if you  help us with this matter. We have thought  to buy a cd or a book. He loves to read books. What do you believe? If he needs something else, we are happy to buy this. I am looking forward to hearing from you soon especially as I am concerned about this matter. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Nowadays people's life has many problems which need some solutions. Especially younger's life has been very difficult  the last  years. The only appropriate  to solve people's problems is the family. Teenagers usually think about a matter which is drugs. Their family could explain  them how they avoid things. They know the way to do this. And the way is love. Apart from this, parents could be very helpful to their children with difficulties of school. They help their children with lessons and give them some useful advice with their relationships. Because sometimes they are upset when they lose a friend. On the other hand, friends are not suitable  to do this. Definately, they don't give real solutions and advice. There is a chance  not to be so good friends and imitate that they are. The way  which  family comes in contact with the members so easily is love. So we should trust only our family when we need help or solutions of our problems. ",29.0

If we will make one reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events we can make intrestede more people. We can inaute stars and artists from around the world who will make and prisentspresent all kind of music like jazz, rock, classical ect. It should be done show so people can see how people in every corner of the word make theyr own fun. Art exhibitions is  good idea too, to introdus how the music is making and show how the instruments lode. Afterward we could let people talk with  artists so they can get knoe theyr privacy. Mr. Jane if you want get more of my suggestions and opinions about it pleace contact with me on my calle phone  Sincirley  [SEP]  Dear Simona! Thank you for your letter it was so nice to hear from you gain and I am glad you have meant this subject. It's believed that English schools look different and have different rules then Polish schools but may be we might find sth incomon?!  What rules do we have in our schools? The first of all it dipends what kind of school it is? Primary, highschool or university! I think that now Polish schools are going foward but they still have lots of bad habits. Polish students have to study a lot with books and they have less pracite lessons,  sometimes it's hard to get a books or other neaded things  to study.  Conneat between students and their teachers or principals is very poor! During the lesson we are not allowed to have food or stg drink,  we can't be late to school School  supose to be our second home but it's not we work hard and for the end  our education we still have nothing. You asking me what would I change? I would make schools more unstressfull,  added fun cause it's easeyer  way to learn and I would gives students more chances to share yo with their fantazy at school. Maybe  Polish system is not bad, but it's conftyble too. I know that that letter will not change anything but you can see how compliated is  Polish studen's life Your   ",20.00
1138," Dear Mr Robertson, Thank you for your effort, which you have made to organize this three days programm in London and I am sure that we will have a great time there especially in the National Art Gallery. Nevertheless, the students in my class have some suggestions for you  how to make it even more interesting. The thing is that we have seen an advertisment for the London Fashion and Leisure Show. It will be held in  Central Exhibition Hall in London on Tuesday, 14th of March, from 10.00 to 19.00. Naturally, all the students are interested in it because the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles will be shown there. Futhermore, students can enter free! We are concerned that this is a great and the only opportunity for us to see this show, as it takes place only once a year and only in London. Certainly, we do not refuse to take part in other activities in London. Probably, you will agree just to put  London Fashion and Leisure Show instead of  Science Museum and shopping on Tuesday. Thank you for your attenlion and understanding. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  The Home of the Future Dear Reader, I have decided to describe my home of the future or, in other words, the place where people will live in 100 years. Well, I suppose that almost everything in  future house will be automatic and will obey to what people say. Perhaps, there will be personal computers, which will control every thing, every item of furiture, light, temperature. Moreover, they will be able to create a special climate for each room. But, on the other hand, people will still have to programm them, as they have to do nowadays. Maybe children will not have to go to school, they just will stay in their rooms and study from  computer,  some kind of on-line education. All the rubbish, dust, dirty dishes, plates, caps will be washed and cleaned automaticly. It is possible that only one computer will do this all and it will have its own personality, voice, eyesight.. This will be your home, another member of your family and your house or flat together. This is my opinion of the Home of the Future and I wish I could live in it. ",35.00

FOR CULTUR LESSONS WE DON'T NEED TO GO SO  BACK IN TIMES, FOR THE LAST 60 YEARS OUR CULTURES HAVE BEEN CHANGING ENORMOUSLY  WE CAN TALK ABOUT COMPUTERS, WARS, CARS, WEAPONS, ETC....

1033," Dear Mr. Robertson, I am writing  you to thank  for your program which will be for us in the next three days in London. Especially, sightseeing by bus in the morning and  river trip to Greenwich in the afternoon are exciting activities. On your program of Tuesday is very interesting. Fortunately, there is the London fashion and leisure show which is held once a year. This show  give us a lot of informations about current activities, fashion and what is happened here in London  for example  lastest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up,  hairstyles. It is a great opportunity because we will be able to learn  london culture. We can be part of this show and be up to date with style and fashion. The admission is free for students. The show starts at 10.00 and finishes at 19.00 so we can change our afternoon program  to go to the show at  Central Exhibition Hall instead. If you agree, after  Science Museum, we can have lunch at  restaurant near the musuem, then we  go directly from the restaurant to  Central Exhibition Hall. We will be on time for the second show at 13.30 P.M and we can enjoy the show until 19.00 P.M. I'am looking forward to hearing your opinion on my suggestion. Your sincerely,  [SEP]  The Home of the Future ""Home"" has so much meaning to the people. It doesn't mater who they are, where they are coming from, which color of their skin they have. Home is  institution that create human and make them as a person and a good member in their communities. When I think of ""the Home of the Future"". I want to have a home which is built with a new material. Home made out of plastic  also windows made out of plastic therefore we can have our home for a long time. The door it is broken, we can replace it rapidly and it is not expensive when it is plastic. We have more time to stay together at home, watching TV, playing games, etc.... because we can access to  internet at home we can have all  informations from  internet. I think it is the best way of education and working when we can stay and learn or work from home. We have more time for the family who need mostly care and love. It will be a numer of Developments in Technology in the future, which can make our life easier to live but what should remain the same is  feeling of being together and love. This 2 feelings can not be replaced by any Technology but we can use them to make a better home of the future. ",26.00

Unforgivly, my climbing skill is no where like my tennis skill, but I alway love climbing. I'm afrade of hights and eversince I alway want to conqure that fear!

We need to show what students interests in and which subject  are interested . I think Science are one of the interesting subject in school. It is very interesting and fun with the experement. Lot and lot of experements which give out quit an interest and amazing results and I think Science is very useful in life. We can see a lot of interest faces on the students wile we  filming them. Also it  not a very easy subject so we can capture other students faces in confuse and puzzal. Also drama is one of the most fun and interest subject. We can see students expressing their feeling, wonderful and excitting story that the student made up or from a will know story. Another excitting subject which most of the students likes very much is P.E. Many students like to play sports. (I'm one of them). It  a good idea to have that in. Plus you can use me as a main person because I'm very good at it. We can also film life after school. After school activities is one of the main thing in school. There are lot of interest activities doing on such as, painting, swimming, football, basketball, reading, drama, and much much more. We can capture bits of each activities and used it as a finish clips for our film.  ",31.0
128," Dear Mr James, My name is Paula and I'm one of your latest visitors of your show ""Over the Rainbow'', this is also the reason of my letter. Last week during my holiday in London, I found your advertisment in my newspaper. This looked very good to me, one of my favourite actors, the time did suit me and  for the tickets was a discount available. Everything was just perfect. But, suddenly the whole evening changed into something, we didn't expected at all. The first disappointment confronted us on the main entrance, there was no discount for our ticket available. Despite of this we have still been looking forward to the show and Danny Brook. Your state in your advertisment that he would come on stage, but instead of him someone else turned up. Actually, this guy was not half as good as Danny Brook. The other thing was the time, the show was supposed to start at half past seven, but we have been waiting for 45 minutes, before the light turned off. Till then we have been very upset about the evening and decided to go for dinner. Eventually, the restaurant which belongs to the theatre was closed.  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. I really do regret that I told Pat about my feelings for the new girl in class, but who else can I talk to, if it is not your best friend?. Her name is Carla and she just changed school, she is so beautiful, with long legs, blond hair and a voice which makes me melt. I've never been so fascinated by a girl and so I knew it must have been real love. Luckely I could keep my secret for a couple of days but then, it became urgent and I needed someone to talk to. Pat, he was my friend, and he knew girls. I thought he would keep everything like a thing between him and me, but he disappointed me. He actually went to Carla and told her every thing. No doubt she would never ever look at me again. But she did, she asked me out. The horrible thing about this is, I'm still in heaven, but  out with the wrong person, because Pat mixed the persons with their names. There are two Carlas in my class! ",23.0

If it is possible I would like to travel in July because school is finishing on the 28th June and I have already excepted a job in August. I think it would be fun to stay in a tent those two weeks, I have never done that before, by my friends told me that I would enjoy it. As you offer many activities it was hard to choose which ones I want to do, but I dicided to take swimming and photography, because I am very good at swimming and because currently I am attending a photography course in Vienna. I am not very experienced but I think that I will find a lot of beautiful motives in the USA. I would be very kind if you could inform me about how much money I have to take with me and which clothes I will need. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Dear Kim, Thank you for the card you wrote to me, I hope you enjoyed your holidays. I spent some great days in Vienna where I had the chance to help at the concert of ""pearl jam"". The first thing I didwas to controll the tickets of the fans who visited  the concert together with a friend of mine. There always was a lot of security stuff around us to make sure every thing is ok, because there really were thousends of persons. Then we had time to listen to the music. The other thing I had to do was to make some sandwiches and drinks just before they returned behind the stage to rest a little bit before they continued playing. It was amazing to be in the same room they were . Edi Vedder even talked to me about their programms! I think that I will never see them again personally, but I will never forget those two days - being so close to them, unbelievable! Hope to see you soon ! Yours ",32.0

Firstly I will be able to travel just in july because my class starts the month after this. Secondly, although the long cabins appeal to me, I would prefer the tents because I think it is more comfortable and atractive. Finally I would like to practise basketball and swimming, because in my school I used to train those sports a lot. Even now in a sport center, but not much. Let me know which kind of cloth I have to carry with me as well as the money that we will need. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable Nowadays most of the people are atractted by shopping centers, which is not always enjoyable. So, I have some opinions to this, which I would like to tell. First of all I think people have to be careful in the things that they buy because probably  are not a good quality, this is very annoyed. Secondly, people have to look after their money in the shops, and don't spend it in the thing that they don't need because by the end of the month they won't have  money. Finally I think the product of the shops are in a good quality and reasonable price, but sometimes the staff of the shop is not very friendly with you, I think is not very nice to buy the thing there, with these people.

1182," Dear Mrs Smith, Thank you for your letter. Surely I'll try to help you as good as I can. First, I  tell you the name of the hotel, it's the Palace Hotel. Fortunately, it is not far from our college. For getting from the hotel to the conference, you only have to take bus no.7 and get off at St. James College, where the conference will take place. About the end-of-conference party I can only say that a band will be playing the whole night, and a special guest I still don't know  will be expected. I suggest to wear casual clothes, I think there's no need of school uniforms. To answer your last question, I would propose you to attend the local zoo, because many baby animals were born in the past few days. Dear Mrs Smith, I hope the given information is useful for you. I'm looking forward to seeing you at the conference. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  The telephone Could you imagine there's no telephone ringing in an office? Or to live your live without chatting for hours with your best friend? Could you? I can't! The telephone was invented by Alexander Graham Bell in the end of the 19th century. It was an invention nobody thought how important and how widespread it would be in  future. Nowadays almost every household in the western world owns a telephone, and calling to relatives or friends spread all over the world is no strange thing. People need the telephone not only for chatting, but also for exchanging information in a very short and direct way with the possibility to answer immediately. When I was a child, we had no telephone at home, and I always had to go to a phone box in the centre of our village. Now I have my own flat, and the first piece of furniture I've bought was the telephone. I'll never take it away from my home. ",34.00
1044," Dear Mr Robertson, Thank you for the programme which you have organised  the three days in London. However, some students in our class have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and we would like to have an opportunity to go to the show. The show is opened between ten and seven p.m on Tuesday, March 14 at  Central Exhibition Hall in London. Latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles are expected to be displayed and studied. We have concerned it as a great opportunity to touch a part of  latest cultures, which are concentrated and sharpened in London. In addition, the addmission for students is free. Taking the programme and the show into consideration, we suggest that we can have time to go to the show in the afternoon on Tuesday. We suppose that in  free time on Wednesday we can find some time for shopping. We hope that you consider our suggestion. Yours sincerily,  [SEP]  The ways of living are always changing. It is no doubt that  functions and structures of the home have been changing as well as that of transformation, for example, have been. Thinking about the home of the future, first of all, nuclear families should be expected because of new technologies, which make house-keeping easier and simpler and because of the idea which encourages us to live in cities for  convenient life. People may tend to avoid from living in a large number of families in an expected small house in a city. On the other hand, the bond between parents and children should be unlikly to change. People always need their parents, children and so on. The longer and further they live on their own, the more they may feel that they need a family. New materials will surly change the home of the future in any ways. It is just staff's around us improving and turning into new one. Hopefully, the minds of people will stay peaceful and tender in the future. ",24.00
229," Dear Mr Smith, I'm terribly sorry but I would notice you about a very disappointing evening. I'm sure you'll read this letter, with the intention of explaining the problems  had during the musical show of his theatre. One of the causes of my disappointing was the different actor that played  the show. I like very much Danny Brook, and his unaspected absence caused on me a big sadness. Then,  musical show had to start at 19,30..why at 20:15 there was also the light on? You'll be agree with me that 45 minutes to waiting for the starting of the show is a too long time. The advertisement for the show indicated discounts available and  open restaurant after the show but it wasn't in this way. The restaurant was closed 'cause of illness.. of who? It's  strange thing! For those reasons I ask you for some money back, sure of my good reasons. Greetings  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. It's for this reason that now I'm in this terrible situation. I can't believe she said that, I was at the Maria's party and 'cause of my distraction, I said Pat that I had lost the Jon's shirt. I was agree to buy another one, of the same style, but now he's angry with me, 'cause I didn't say anything to him. I don't know how to do. He's my best friend and so he wanted from me all the truth I can give him. It's all right, but I also think that he's too exagerate. I don't think  of having done  a so bad thing  to broke our friendness. I feel sad and shocked. I like his company, and we are happy when we are togheter. I can't finished  'cause of a girl that can't keeping a simple secret. ",20.0

The Hotel that is booked for the students it is one of the beast in the area, it has great facilities and it is situated near to the place where the conference is going to be. The best way to get there from The hotel is by bus and it is already booked for the next day you arrive, at 8:30 am. About the party which is just at the end of the conference, a good it would be a dance party and the students don't really need to wear special clothes, it's just to have a little dance and meet all the students, after the party there is a small trip to the old part of the city and I think it would be a good choice  to spend the last three hours that you have left before go back. I hope this letter aswer all your questions, if you whant to know more about it just give me a call or send me a letter. your sincerely  [SEP]  The aim of this report is to give some information about The new Acapulco resart buildings which was build 10 years ago and it is one of the first buildings that was build with the latest tecnonology and made by a important Mexican arquitector. In addition the resort has an interesting History background about  arquitectory and the best facilities and activities that you could have in Mexico for example, it provides differents kinds of tours around Mexico. On the contrary it is far away from the city and it has difficult transport facilities. In spite of the disadvantages, I would strongly recomended to students and  public to visit the new Acapulco resort buildings. and have a great experience knowing about  buildings history and at the same time traveling around Mexico.

460," 17th June 2000 Dear Sir, Having seen with two of my friends your musical show last week-end at The Circle Theatre which  called ""OVER THE RAINBOW"", I am writing to complain about our disappointing evening. First of all, in your advertisement you refer to discounts that are available, but when we bought our tickets, one of the employees refused to give us 'tickets student price'. Despite being forced to buy adult tickets, we still were excited and took our seat, and waited for the beginning of the show. Usually, the show starts at 19:30, but this time we had to wait until 20:15! In addition to this, it was not the famous actors that you have mentionned in the advertisement , so we were disappointed. Concerning the restaurant, it was closed due to transformations. In the result, I am sure you will understand our annoyed and frustrated, so it was not a perfect evening out that your advertisement stated  was. Finally, I am writing to request a full-refund for my friends and I, because I felt your advertisement was misleading. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully, H. Boulard  [SEP]  What do you think about what will clothes be like in the future? I'm sure that anyone has already thought about it, because fashionable clothes have always been really important for almost all of us. Let's have a look at different points. From the past until now, we have  wearing several different  fashionable clothes, but why? From my point of view, almost all humans would like to be more and more attractive, so we always think about it. As a result, clothes are the easiest way to be more attractive. In addition to this, anyone will agree with me that clothes are the best invention ever. Furthermore, it's one of the best way to make money. Anyway, don't you think that nowadays, fashionable clothes is quite similar than  20 years ago? It's evident that whatever we wear look like clothes, and I think we should stop being so stupid. We can't wearing peculiar clothes like in science fiction films.

872," Dear Sir or Madam, Thank you for your letter. I'm very happy that I have won. You ask me when I would like to travel? I can travel only in July because I have  holidays from my work only in this month. So it would be very nice, if it's possible. By the Accomodation at the Camp, I would prefer the tents, because it is something different wich you don't make everyday! Then the activities that I would like to do are Singing and Swimming. Singing because it's my favourite hobby and I grew up with it and Swimming because I like water and the feeling that you have when you are in it. Another reason for  swimming is that I'm good at it because a few years ago I had lessons, where I learn very good swimming. Finaly I've got a question: What clothes must I bring with me and how much money? I'm looking forward  hearing from you. yours faithfuly,  [SEP]  Everybody likes shopping! To look for clothes and shoes is for every women one of their favourite hobby and if it were possible they would stay the whole day in the shopping-centre. But shopping isn't always enjoyable. Sometimes it isn't so easy to find what you need. For example: you have in your memory a great pair of shoes that you have seen last week in a shop. Now you will by it but it's nowhere to find! That's a pity! Sometimes it's very awful when you have to wait  very long  until it's your turn to pay or to try some clothes on. Another thing that makes you fourious, is when you see a great shirt in  shop and somebody else take it away or buy it before you can react. That things had happend to everybody, hadn't they? So you see that shopping isn't always enjoyable. ",24.0
42," Dear Ms. , I am writing this letter to express my thoughts about the International Art Festival of this year. I was so impressed  the exhibitions of the festival that you had organized. Furthermore, it's  worthful experience for people  to know  the other countries' arts. But I would like to suggest some requests for the festival. Firstly, it is better to invite more artists not only from six countries. For example, the artists or stars from we have rare chance to feel the atmosphere. Secondly, some concert halls were too small to enter all of the audience. Moreover, plays and films were shown only twice a day so that people had gathered one time. I would prefer to be held more performances next year in the bigger halls. Finally, regards to tickets, it is  very wonderful idea because it is more combinient to enjoy the festival for one day among a lot of people. You may consider my suggestion to have the art festival for next year. Yours Sincerely  [SEP]  Long long time ago, there were the old man and old woman  lived in a foot of  mountain. One day, when the old man went into the bambo bush, he found one bambo gritted white. He had never seen such bambo before but decided to cut it down. Then there was a lovely baby in it. He was surprised but was pleased because he had no child. He took the baby to his house and explained what had happened in the bush to the old woman. The old woman was glad to have a baby and they decided to bring up the baby. The baby was named 'Kaguya.' She grew very quick and was so beautiful. A lot of men asked her to marry with them but she always refused. One full moon night she said to her parents sadly, 'I have to return to the Moon tonight.' The old man and woman tried to keep her staying  their house, but they couldn't. The servants from the Moon picked her up to the Moon. She gone away. She was the princess of the Moon. This story happened a long time ago. ",23.00
347," Dear Sir/Madam, I recently had a holiday in London and had been to your musical show 'Over the Rainbow' but found it very disappointing. It is said that the singers are Danny Brook and Tina Truelove in the advertisement. However, there was a different unknown actor in that. The show started later at 20:15 which was very different in '19.30' as shown. There was no discount at all which is in contrast with 'Discounts Availabe'. After the show, I wanted to have something in the theatre restaurant and found it was closed because of no reason. The real show on it owns is really very different to what are mentioned in the advertisement. I am unsatisfied and would like to ask for some money back. Please would you also change the advertisement to the level of the actual facts. Thank you for your attention. Yours faithfully,   [SEP]  What will clothes be like 100 years from now? It is a very hard thing to predict. The fashion of nowaday clothings is just keep on changing. Although some may appears again after  few years different styles are developed. For the fashion of the future, I think it depends on the people's own personalities and  develope their own styles which suits them the most. They can wear different kinds of clothing, like they design for themselves or those like history can wear those of victorian time and in different countries. For the colours, I think the metalic colours, especially silver, will be the most popular. As different kinds of farbics will be invented & the clothings will never be just cotton as always been seen. Maybe paper can also be a farbic use for make clothings and for those who like to wear new clothes everyday. They can be thrown away after wearing it and  light enough to be carried around whenever you want to change  your wearing. ",23.0
495," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing in order to express my extreme dissatisfaction with the musical show 'Over the Rainbow' that recently took place in The Circle Theatre. During my prior holiday in London I came across an encourageing advertisment for the show and decided to see it. Unfortunately, I was very dissappointed to find out that there were no discounts available! Therefore, it cost me more money then usual. In addition, I was very annoyed by the fact that the event had started at 20:15 - not 19:30 as mentioned in the advertisment. My dissatisfaction became even bigger when I had realize that there had been a different actor than Danny Brook performing! Moreover, I was unable to use the theatre restaurant as it had been closed due to redecoration! Having noticed that this was not 'a perfect evening out' I would like to ask for my money back. I feel as if I had been lied to and thus I demand my money to be returned. I am looking forward to receiving a response in the near future. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Everyone had already heard of me getting the secret access code for the 'Secret Society' organisation. This was the kind of association everybody knew of but nobody talked about. Everyone was aware that telling aloud about  'Secret Society' could get you in trouble, serious trouble. There had been cases when somebody entered the club but never came back afterwards. I guess it was that thrill that actually made me anxious to know what really was going on inside the dodgy-looking old house guarded by a man with an unfriendly hound. I've always enjoyed the hazard and this time getting the password was, indeed, a tough coockie. But knowing what these people are capable of makes me doubt wether to use it or not. Especially now, when 'big-mouth' Pat spread the news to litterally everyone. I wouldn't be surprised if suddenly something bad happened to me. Therefore, I have to escape. What I've learned from this situation is to never trust people again. You should remember about this in the future. ",32.0
712," Dear Mrs Ryan, First of all I would like to thank you for the perfect organisation of the competition which I luckely won, I have been really very impressed. Unfortunately I became your letter with two weeks late so I can travel only between the 5th and the 20th July. In fact I will finish my university's exams only on the first  July and after the 20th  is impossible because I am going to do four weeks volontary  in India for UNICEF. If it is possible I would prefer to stay in a log cabins, because, in spite of my love for nature, I am terribly allergic to pollins. So  stay in a log cabins will probably evite me a lot of problems. Choose two activities from the list has been very difficult but I think I would like to do climbing,  sport in which I have many years of experience, and surfing despite I really have any experience. Unfortunately I had ever been in the US so I have any idea about how much money I will probably need and about what kind of clothes I have to take with me. Thank you very much for your attencion on my regard Your sincerely  [SEP]  If you ask at twenty womans what is their favorite hobbies probably the most of them will answer ""shopping"". But why is shopping so popular and loved by so many people all over the world? Why so many people have been contaged by this ""psychologic virus""? The verb ""have"" is probably the most used and loved by the human species. We are always trying to have more things, that in spite of care after us family, us future, or other things which are probably more important than a new perfum. Always more people, everywhere, are becoming shopping-addicts. Maybe you can think I am excessive but recent studies prouves that this mania can be really dangerous. Certenly the only fact of have something can helps people to be more sure of himself. In fact if you have the new Kalvin Klein model for a certain kind of people you are cool, but it is really so important? Probably when Oscar Wilde said: ""Superficiality is the suprem vice"" he was right. We still look at what people look like and not at what they really are. ",29.0
806," Thank you very much for this occasion I'd like to travel only in July, because, in the rest of the year, I'm working in a bank. The second reason is the weather. I love travelling when the weather is warm. About the accommodation, I'd prefer to stay in  log cabins, because for me and my family's more comfortable. I have a baby and three dogs, so it should be better in  log cabins. I'd like spend all of  time in a swimming-pool because I love swimming. I like also surfing, because I love the wind in the hair and the fresh on my body. Only one question about a baby's accomodation. May I have a babysitter? I'd like to have more free time for myself and my health. I've never been there, so it will be a pleasure for me. Let me say still thank you. I'm looking forward to meting you Best regards Irene Venerio  [SEP]  Dear Kim, How are you? I'm fine. I'm sorry I didn't write  you before, but I was so busy with my exams. First of all, I want to tell you what happened last month. Do you remember which is my favourite group? So, You don't believe me, but I enjoed helping at a Oasis's pop concert. I was a great and wonderful experience. The group needs to found a good microphone for the concert, because the singer lost his microphone last concert. Me and my friend were there to hear the sound-check, and when I understood  was happing on the stage, I decided to help them. Of course you know, I'm a singer, so I came back quigky to my home, I picked  my microphone, and I handed it to the singer. The concert was absolutely fantastic. I was so glad, because in the ending of  show the singer kissed me and dedicated to me a lovely song. Can you immagine? Ok, write  me soon, huge hug and kisses Yours Irene ",29.0
1019," Dear Mr Robertson, I was interested in an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and I would really love to go to the show. I am writing to appriciate for the good programme. It was so kind of you to have organised the programme. I would enjoy to see the show, especially a fashion show. I am keen on wearing and drawing some clothes. This show starts on Tuesday in  Central Exhibition of London from 10:00 AM to 7:00 PM. Especially, students are free! It will be  great opportunity for me. I feel that it is such a nice experience and worthy. I would like to suggest  idea and change  sightseeing by bus on Monday, because the English weather is so changeable. If it rains, we will not be pleasant. Some of  friends would like to go to the British Museum and I have not been there before. Thank you again and I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear friend How are you? I'm fine. Thank you a lot for your letter and I hope you and your family are well. It's a good idea to give a book for your cousin's birthday present. I would like to recommend 'The Old Man and The Sea' because I've read it when I was teenager. It was such a wonderful story that I remember the old man speaking about human's life between the sea and the man. It may make him think of his future and this book could be very suitable for him. Let me know if he likes it or not and I hope we'll be able to get together before too long. I'm looking forward to hearing from you Love ",21.00
248," Dear Sir, Being on a holiday trip in London, I dreamed  to go to the theatre for a musical show. I saw your advertisement last Monday, and thought ""It is that one that I want to try."" In fact, your musical show was attractive: actors, time, restaurant, discount tickets, and also the title! I started to be OK with the ""Your perfect evening out"", sure  not  to be deceived. But all was disappointing! First, as I am very found of Danny Brook, I have been surprised  he totally changed his voice, face, and so on! It was not Danny on the scene! Second bad point: beeing not narrowminded, I accept other actors.. but  if the show begin on time - he began at a quarter past eight P.M. There were no discount places because it was not planed like this by the theatre. What was written on the advertisement? The summum was reached when I saw the restaurant was closed for ""holidays"". I was terribly ennoyed! I spent the worse evening of my holiday in this show! So I need now a ""perfect - money back -"" for replacement of your ""perfect evening out"". I do hope you will accept and understand this request. Yours:  [SEP]  ""How has modern technology changed your daily life?"" First of all, ""daily life"" concerns (as far as I am concerned) my life everywhere, and more precisely at home, at the university and at work. Up to two years ago, I was working with a written booknote or agenda, and I used to phone with a wired phone system. Nowaday, I organise my activities with an electronic organizer that authorizes me to connect to  Internet by infra-red link with my mobile phone to get informations and electronic mails. I am always joinable with my mobile phone, that is also sometimes boring! Being in an apprenticeship, I go  both work and university. At the university, I have learned with computer aided systems. I often go on  Internet to find informations for studying a precise subject more accutely (university technology sites). At work my personal job uses two standard PC with specifical softwares plus one workstation with the Stanford University Network (SUN) operating system and a particular computer that my firm is developping now. At home, I have got a personal computer for my mails and accounts, and electronic mail plus  internet for keeping connected to my friends that are at the other end of France or Germany, Korea and so on. So modern technology has totally changed my daily life! ",31.0
882," Dear Sir/Madam I am glad to hear from you recently and I really appreciate your invitation to California. I would like to tell you about my preference. To start with I would rather stay in a log cabin because two weeks might be too long to stay in a tent and a log cabin would be more convenient for me. When it comes to activities, I would like to try climbing and surfing. I started surfing when I was 12. So I am quite confident with this. Although I had a few experiences of climbing, my everyday training at gym would retrieve my concerning. In addition to these reasons, both activities are popular especially in California. And I also have to ask you what kinds of clothes will be suitable there. Or approximately how much money would be enough to buy surveniers because this will be  first time for me to visit Carifolnia. Finaly, I must choose traveling there in July because I am not allowed to take holidays in other months due to my work. Thank you very much for your time and I am looking forward to visiting there. Yours Faithfully,  [SEP]  Needless to say, shopping can cause you a waste of time and money. However some people might be opposed to this general understanding because they believe that they can find shopping enjoyable. Those who love shopping are usually suffer from serious stress and may seek out satisfaction by shopping. However, things which you can get by money  necessarily fill your unsatisfaction or even as you buy something more and more, your emptiness might be bigger. And shopping is also a difficult hobby to go along with your friends or your pertners. What you want is often different from what your friend wants. Unless either you or your partner is really tolerant, shopping could result in another stress. So it is advisable not to make a friend whose hobby is shopping. In addition to these, everyone has regretted buying unnecessary things and those things would remind you how  silly decision you had done at the moment. On the whole, shopping can be harmful rather than enjoyable because you migh be extravacant, lose your friends and have what you don't need. ",28.0
441," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to complain about the musical show ""Over the Rainbow"". Firstly, the actors were supposed to be Danny Brook and Tina Truelove. However, Danny Brook did not appear in the show, it was another actor. This was really disappointing. Secondly, the show was really late . It started at 20.15, not at 19.30 as it was supposed to be. And, although you have promised  in your advertisement, there were no discounts available. To make things worst, the restaurant was closed. The manager said it was closed because they had not been informed that there would be a show in that date. To sum up, it was not a perfect evening out. And, I would appreciate  if you give me a refund. I look forward to hear from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  What will clothes be like 100 years from now? In my opinion, the clothes will be more colourful, funny and confortable. I think that we will not use formal clothes anymore. People will prefer to use confortable clothes, even to go to the office. The clothes will be more colourful and consequently more funny. We will not use black clothes as we are used to do. People will use yellow, pink and green clothes. This way, people tend to be happier. However, the clothes will not be as  teenagers use to wear nowadays to go to ""raves"". It will be more beautiful and clean. Mainly, people will not be so fashionable as they are nowadays. They will wear a  clothe only if they feel good wearing it. Actually, I think that the clothes will be really simplier in 100 years and I hope to be alive until then. ",27.0
207," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to complain about the musical show I went  last week. I spent a week's holiday in London and I had been looking forward to watching a wonderful show in your theatre. However, I was completely disappointed with that. Firstly, although I bought a ticket for 19:30 the show started at 20:15. It would never happen in my country I must say. Secondly, there was no discounts despite you showed it was available in your advertisement. Furthermore, your theatre restaurant was closed because the employees were on the strike. On top of everything, the main cast, Danny Brook, did not appear on the show. The actor who played instead of him was terrible. In fact, I expect a full refund plus compensation for the dissatisfaction suffured. I trust you will give an immediate attention to this letter and I look forward to receiving a satisfactory responce in return of post within a week. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  When we think about clothes in the future, we should think about the enviroment first. What will it be like in 2100? It is not pleasant to say the earth is now facing some serious problems. But it is the fact. Air-pollution might become more serious than now in the future and  destruction of  ozon-zone could not be stopped in 100 years. Considering these elements, we should wear clothes which can protect us from certain kind of sun rays and air pollution. I suppose they would be like a arm-suits. Of course, technologies will have developped enough  to invent new material for those kind of clothes. So we don't have to worry about how heavey they will be. We will feel as if we put on nothing. In conclusion, clothes after 100 years will not  as fashionable as they are now. We should consider wearing as in more practical way. ",28.0

About accomodation at Camp California, I would rather be in a tent than in a log cabin because in July the weather is really good and when I am in a tent I feel closer of nature.

I will never forget this moment. But don't worry, I thought about you and he signed an autograph for you, you will find it with this letter. On the other hand I worked very hard because the concert finished very late and after the concert I had to clean up the room and you can't imagine how dirty the fans are!

I am very pleased to help to organize this Conference in our College, which will hold at  Conference Centre at Bromley College starting on 20th June for 3 days. please find  information your required as follows: We have booked the hotel for the group. Called ""palace Hotel"" which is about 10 miles away from our College, the hotel will have a coach to pick the group up from the airport on  19th of June and then take the group to  Conference and return to  hotel every day.

At 7:00pm. we can move to our student hall to have a disc dance until 10:00pm. On the last day, we have arranged a small party in the hotel, then we all set up to have a sightseeing  Bromley town center for about two hours before you leave for  airport. Bromley town center is the most beautiful shopping centre in South East London. There are many historical buildings remain. I think the students will enjoy this sightseeing . If any further discussion, please let me know. Yours. sincerely,  [SEP]  How wonderful ""light"" We need light every day, not just  night time. We need lamp light in offices or schools or some places during the day time. How is the wonderful life after  invention the  light. Here we just talk about the light we invented apart from nature light. When I was small, we lived in country yard, I remembered, we used to have oil lamps which used a cotton string dipping in the oil in the small bottle and made it burned the tip of the cotton string to give us light during the night time, it was very little light on, and  many things we couldn't do under the  oil lamps because the light range was very small. There was no any light outside our house,  no light on the road or field either. I was always very scared whenever or wherever . because most places. Covered by dark, dark and dark. This scaring dark is still affecting my life now. I never stayed out after dark today except accompanying by my family. What a biggest person on the earth, who invented the light, Einstein was. He created another day time after sunset, people use it to do anything they want to do, We believe we can't live without light today, specially in  city life, we have a long time to spend for the activities after  Sun going to bed. Which we definately need light to keep on. I dare to say, without light, our life will go into a dark, dark hell. ",29.00

First of all, I would like to travel only in June given that my wife will come with me: her holiday are only in June. Concerning accommodation at Camp California, would it be possible to live in  log cabins? Indeed, my wife is afraid of sleeping in tents. Moreover, I practice Basketball in a famous French Club: That is the reason why I would like to choose the Basketball. If I had to chose an other activity, I think I would do Photography. In fact, this activity seems to be very interresting. Unfortunately, I have never practiced but I feel to like discovering that. Finally, I would want to ask you whether we had to bring  money: Life is so expensive there! Furthermore, what sort of clothes must we have for the different activities? I hope my answers will satisfy you. I thank you again. Yours sincerely Tom Turner  [SEP]  After having thought about this video and asked different people so as to know what they suggested, I reached the following conclusions: we must film the lessons which are the most important and the activities which take  a great part in a day at school; this being in three parts. the morning That is why I propose to start our film with the beginning of the day, when all  students come in  class. Then, we should film the English class so as to show who makes the film. Furthermore, as Mathematics are the main lesson in the morning, we ought to film  a time where we are in  MathClass the lunch After that  could come  the lunch which takes two hours per day. The better  to do would be to present the cooking personnal for they are very nice. the afternoon We could begin the afternoon with the sport, showing the different places with  surroundings (near the wild): it would give a good impression. I advise to finish with a lesson of Chemistry so that people see the laboratery. Before that, I would have showed the break at 3 o'clock which is important for us. ",24.0

I will join in  the swimming group and the photography group. Both of them are my hobbies, I have won some prizes in my school competition of them. Therefore, I am quite confident about them. I would be grateful if you could put me into the tent side of accomodation because I have had all  holidays with my parents in luxury hotels before. I would like to try it this time. As all the travel expenses are paid already, I would appreciate it if you could tell  what kind of clothing  also how much pocket money I need. I look forward to hearing from you in due course.

You know, although I'm a pop music fan, I'd never had any idea how it was prepared for opening. First, they asked me to put those instruments on the stage. I left the hi-fi system on the left side (it should be on the other side). Before  opening, the pop star found the mistake, otherwise it would be a disaster. The performer, Paul, is a big music name at the present. But I'd never met him before. This time, I saw him in person. I told him I loved his songs, he was very happy. Then, we stroke a lovely conversation. Afterwards, he gave  his pen for my enthusiasm. Anyway, how are you? Write soon, tell me how you're getting on in your new job. Best wishes, ",33.0
1065," 1/3/2000 Dear Mr. Robertson. I'm a student in  English class which  going to spend three days in London (13th-14th March) and I'm a representative student from my class  to thanks you about your programme that you've already organised for us. It's really wonderful especially the River trip to Greenwich. We feel  can't wait until that time. However, the students in my class, we have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show which will be on 14th March between 10.00 to 19.00 at the Central Exhibition Hall, London. The show has many interesting parts such as  latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and Hairstyles and we are all agreed that it's a great opportunity for us because most of us are going to study  Fashion and Design course in next term and the other students are also interesting in new fashion. So we think that it will be useful for all of us. Anyway, we still want to go to the Science Museum and shopping as well but we think we can go shopping on the last day afternoon of our trip. So we will have  free time on the afternoon of the 14th March and we can spend this time enjoy the show. I'm also include the show's leaflet on the back of this letter. What do you think about this plan? I'm looking forward to see your programme.  [SEP]  I believe that everyone in this world have curiosity. We're always want to know about others' life especially the famous one even the one that we hate. But we have to accept that everyone has their private life for example when we get married or when  policeman stop us on the highway, we don't want any stranger notice that what is happening to us. Famous people are also the normal people like us just because their jobs are known by every people, it doesn't mean that we can invade their privacy. They also want to have  special time with their family or their friends. It's not fair for them to have journalists following them and take their photographs and some journalists write the news that  not true. We also can't deny that the journalists' job is to know what's going on with these famous people. But it doesn't mean that they have to follow these stars all the time, they should give them some privacy. On the other hand, these stars should accept that they are famous people so everyone wants to know about their life. The best way is  they, the famous stars and the journalists, should compromise and respect each other's rights. ",32.00

232," To: the manager of The Circle Theatre From: Subject: complaint Dear Sir or Madam, I was at the show of your theatre three days ago. Unfortunately, my expectations have not been realized because of  many problems I had during the show. First of all, there was another actor instead of Danny Brook (as it was written in the advertisement). Secondly, the show was delayed and started at 20.15 so I had to wait 45 minutes doing absolutely nothing and wasting my time. No discounts were given and, what is more, your theatre restaurant was closed all the time. I was not able to have a dinner after the show. On the whole, I was very disappointed  having left the Circle Theatre. All the impressions were destroyed by many problems. I ask you for returning my money back. Or I will have nothing to do except for going to the court. Faithfully,  [SEP]  Fashion of the Future Three hundred years ago fashion changed up one time in each hundred years. One hundred years ago it was one time in 50-25 years. And now we have to change some of our clothes every 6 months because they are not so fashionable any more. Fashion is one of the most important parts of our image and everyday life now. Fashion is becoming more useful, all the new inventions and technologies are going to play an important part in the fashion industry of the future. It is very difficult to predict but let us try to imagine what will clothes be like 100 years from now. With no doubt, the influence of modern technologies will be great. Future clothes will be very useful and incredibly comfortable, we can see the progress in the fashion even now. It seems that the decorative role of clothes will have disappeared by the year of 2050. So all the fashion industry will work to make clothes more useful, practical and comfortable. What will we have? Breathing jackets and shirts with air conditioning. ",27.0

You had never made on your  own decision, you always had to ask your family's opinion. I had always wanted to be a theatre actress. I was saving my pocket money to go to the theatre  age  15. During the this years I had met with Zuhal Olcoy. I had seen her every morning while I was going to school. Despite of  going to school by bus  easier than riding  bycyle I had prefered to going to school by bycyle to  by bus. In that way I had been able to see her every morning. The more seeing her I could, the more ambitious I became. At last I met wit her. She had invited me  her play to the theatre. When I went to her play to see, I  realy would love to be a actress. She was the only person who encourage me to be a actress. I had had a exam for  being theatre players without saying my family. Otherwise my father could kill me and not let me to go to school.

686," Dear Mr. Ryan Thank you for your letter. I have just received the letter from you. I am really pleased that I have won first prize in your competition at Camp California in  U.S.A. I would like to travel in July this year because I think the weather will be nice and I can take a holiday. I would like to use a tent for my accommodation. I think it is more interesting than  log cabins. I can be more next  nuture and I have never used tents before. It seems to be exciting. I choose swimming and painting for my activities while I am at the Camp. I really like swimming. When I was a child, I used to go swimming with my family at the weekend having a chat, making a barbecue, playing games. It was such a good time. I enjoy painting as well. My mother told me that I'm good at painting. When I was in high school, I won second prize in a painting competition. My parents were very pround of me. Could I ask you some questions? I would like to know which kind of clothes I should bring to the camp. How much money should I bring there and can I use my credit card at the camp? I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Kim, Thank you for your letter. I'm sorry that I've taken such a long time to reply  your letter because I'm really busy and I have to study harder. I'm taking the final exam next month. Lucky me! I've got some great news to tell you. Last month, I worked as a part-time job. I really enjoyed helping at a pop concert. As you know, I'm crazy about pop music. Before the concert I was really exciting. I couldn't sleep well and I didn't know what I had to do in the concert. It was such a big concert. There were lots of singers and  band. Of course, there were lots of spectaculars. First, I was in front of the entrance door. I had to check tickets. I was really exciting. My hands were sclumbling but I did it very well. After that, I went to the back stage. I could see lots of pop stars. I'm sorry that I didn't ask them to take any pictures for you. I was really busy. I had to take care of them and did everything they want. For instance, taking them to  toilet, making coffee for them, helping them find their stuff. It was really busy but I really enjoyed it. I learnt lots of thing from here that I couldn't learn from school. I had to be more patient. I knew lots of people from different job. It was a great time. I'd better close now. I've got lots of homework to do. Take care of yourself and I look forward to hearing from you. Best wishes, ",28.0
1061," Dear Mr Robertson I'm writing to you to complain about  three days programme. Thank you very much for your good programme,  especially for  visiting  The National Art Gallery. All our class like to see the beautiful pictures which were drawn by brilliant artists and painters. We saw an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and our class would like to go to the show. It starts on Tuesday March 14 and we can go there instead of visiting the Science Museum or go shopping. Anyway we can go to the Science Museum on Wednesday afternoon because we have a free time. So on this show there will be the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and even hair styles. All our class and me would like to see this show. You know what else? We don't need to pay, it's for free because we are students. It's a great opportunity because in our fast developing world we have to look fashionable and this kind of show happens quite rare. I think you'll agree that we have changed your programme. As I said we can go to the Science Museum on Wednesday instead of having a free time. I'm looking forward of recieving a letter from you. Thank you very much. Bye  [SEP]  Hello I'm going to write about ""The Home of the Future"". We can't say straight away how the people's homes will be different in the future but we can always imagine and create the unbelievable things about future life. Of course there will be differences between todays homes and the future ones. I think the houses will grow up on twenty floors up to the sky as more and more people will occupy it. I think more and more people will have at least one flat,  doesn't matter if you are rich or not. The rooms will be designed in a future fashion like less furniture and everything is compact, even TV-set will be on the ciling. The rooms will be much bigger and wider than now, and you can have up to twenty rooms in your own flat, and even  swiching on the light by saying only; ""light"". If course if you have enough money to let your self live in such  apartments, then you can afford it. Now what's going to be the same. Well as I said if you're poor, the government still give you the flat but  very ugly one, probably with rats in it. The same problem will be with homeless people who doesn't have money at all, even to buy a food for themselves. They will have to stay on the streets as  streets is their home. I hope and I wish that the future will bring us a good moments of life where everybody will have  home and a warm, friendly family relationships. Bye. ",25.00
952," Dear Helen Ryan, I have recieved your letter and I am so glad I have won the first prize. I have answers to your questions. I would like to travel in July because it is the perfect time for me to go on holiday because the 12th  July is my birthday. I want to sleep in tents because I think it's more adventurous  better scenery, and atmosphere. You also asked me about the two things I'm good at, well, the first one is basketball. I have been playing basketball for roughly about 4 years. I love basketball because I'm good at it and it is my favourite sport. The other thing I'm good at is tennis. I have been practcing tennis for 2 years and I won the Under 16 U.S open tour last summer. Last of all I have questions to ask you. Would I have to bring many clothes e.g. would we do a lot of outdoor activities, get dirty etc. Would I need a lot of money. Looking forward to see you soon. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  This composition is about shopping. People today shops sevendays a week with their family, friends etc. But I think shopping is not always enjoyable. This statement is due to the great amount of rubbish we are providing for the world. The more stuff we buy the more we throw away. Shopping with some friends may be fun but you must also remember that you are spending money. Therefor you should think more carefully about what you are about to buy. You can enjoy yourself in other different ways. For example, you can do sports which is enjoyable and good for your health. Would you rather spend money on something which is destroying the world or do sports which is for your own benefit. You must think about your children who would be living in the world you helped to destroy. The ozone layer is being punctured when plastics or foams are burnt. I think this is all I have to say to make you think that shopping isn't always enjoyable and change your view in looking at shopping. ",31.0
897," Dear Mrs Ryan, In reply to your letter recieved  the 13rd of June, I first would like to say that it is a great pleasure for me to have been choosed. First of all, you've asked me when I wanted to travel. In fact their would be only one possibility in July because I will end with my exams session at the end of this month and beginn a practical trainning the 1rst of August. To continue with the others information you need, I would prefer to sleep in  tent because of the proximity to the nature. Furthermore, I've choosed two activities whose are Sailing and Climbing. I've climbed for 3 years as I was at school and I think that my level is still not too bad. In contrary, I've never sailed in my life and would enjoy to start with at Camp California. To end with, I would like to know how much money we will need for the free time and what kind of clothes and materials do I need to practise the activities I've choosed. I would like to thank you for all, and am looking forward to hearing from you in the near future. Yours sincerely Victoire Bouchard  [SEP]  Dear Kim, How are you? I've well received your last letter and want to thank your for the pictures you've joined with. You've asked me how was the Leysin Rock Festival, but I still cannot find the words to explain how fabulous and unexpectable it was. As you know, I was there to help for the good running of the concert and there was a lot of different things to do. First, I had to control the tickets at the entry. In addition, there were some VIP's to place. Then, during the concert I've helped to serve the beers at the bar. I've met a lot of interresting people while I was serving . Furthermore, I had to make announcements at the loudspeaker for the children who where lost. All was very interresting, but what I particularly liked about the experience is the human relations. I've met a lot of different people and they all have learned me something new about behaviour or compation. I hope we will see us as soon as possible and  am waiting for your answer.

44," International Arts Festival Dear Jane Clark, I am writing to you for your advertisement for the festival. I am  student at London College and studying English. I have always been interesed arts and festivals. It was great that you organised  Art Festival in this City, because people realy needed this kind of sochibal activities here. I have spent two days at the International Arts Festival with some of my friend and I must say we  realy delighted, it was  great idea to do that in London. We all liked  Jazz, rock and classical concerts. However  concert halls were too small and lots of people couldn't get in to  concert halls and there were only six countries stars and artists. I believe  plays and films should be more than it was for next year and  stars and artists should be from round the world. One reasonably priced weeker ticket for all events was excellent because its alway busy for the weekend and people prefer to go any week day. I hope, you will concider about my opinions and  my suggestions would be helpful for the next year. Look forward to hearing from you. Your Sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Freddie I received your letter just this morning. It was very nice to hearing from you. We never like rules, do we? However there are lots of rules in our lives, both at home and at school. In my countries school we are not allowed to have an argument with class-mates and  not allowed to eat at class. We can't listen  music at class as well. We alway have to keep clean every where, but this kind of rules are not very strict I believe. At home  is completely different, my mum is quite organised, so she always puts new rules. Firstly I've to keep clean my room and hoover once a week. I've to cook myself and  worst thing is I'm not allowed to listen  loud music in everywhere at home. I'm not allowed to stay out after midnight. When I groue up I'll change all  rules in my life and I'll make my own rules which are not going to be too strict. Love to hearing from you soon. Love ",25.00

First of all, I can only travel in July because I have tests at school and they are Very important to me and I hope you Will understand my problem. And I Will like to be accommodated in a log Cabin, because I do not like sleeping in tents, because of the bugs and insects. For the activities I would like to chose the Tennis activities, which I am not too bad at, and climbing, Which I have never done but  must be interesting. I Would like to Know if I need to take any clothes, and, if yes, What Kind of Clothes? I also Want to Know if I should take any Money, or if all the expences are payed by You. I am looking forward to your reply. Yours sincerely, Santiago  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable Sometimes people go to the mall to look at products and don't even buy anything. But of course, there are some exceptions. For example, when you buy something, you might lose it and never again see it, or you could be robbed, or even if the product has something wrong with it, then you have to swap it and that takes time. And sometimes the credit card machines don't work, or they don't accept your card or even if you have exceeded the limit of your credit card. Another bad thing is that people want something very badly, and they can't afford it. That makes those people frustrated and they don't enjoy theirselves. ",36.0
536," Dear Helen Ryan, I am writing to thank  for noticing me about the competition and I would be very grateful in giving to you the information  was requiered in your letter. I regret to inform you that I have had some problems in my full-time sales assistant job so, I would rather travel only in July than other months. About the Accommodation I would like you to take careful consideration  that I am ashmatic so, I would appreciatte it if you could reserve a bed in  log cabins. Your letter also mentioned some kind of activities in which we can involve through the camping. I would like to choose painting and photography which are my favourites ones. I have recently finished a three year course of painting and I always be fascinated by the photography. On the other hand, I would also like to know some about further details like wether we need to bring we us some clothes or  it will be provided to us and if we need some money in case we have to afford something. I hope to see you soon. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Kim, Hi. How do you do? You may be asking why I haven't written to you before. Well, I've been very busy you know. Two weeks ago I enrolled in a group to help on building a stage for a concert of a famous singer star. Activities lasting almost 2 days and a half. The first day we have to move to the airport to bring all the equipment by lorries to the camp. It was really awful and hard. I finished the day too tired. However, the second day was less heavier than the first one. We just worked in building the stage and all those of thing. Putting the instrument in the right place, testing all the microphone as well as the sound was the rest of the job. At the end I must confess that it was really amazing hang up and down all the equipment which varied from small microphone to a marvellous huge large black screen of TV. If you had this oportunitty one day, you had better buy the ticket to the concert or just watch it on TV but never do something like  just to get a free pass. My regards to your family. Write  me soon. ",26.0
938," Dear Sir or Madame, I'm so glad to get the news I've won the prize. Many thanks for giving me a chance to stay at the Camp California in the U.S.A. I think I could leave for the camp in July. Because I'm supposed to attend an English course in Weymouth, England until June and then I'm going to travel in Europe with my sister who came from my country 4 weeks ago for this trip. We are planning to spend 2 weeks travelling. So I can go to the camp in the middle of the July. And I'd like to stay in a log cabin. I've had unpleasant experience from my last holidays when I had to stay in a tent. In addition as I haven't stayed in a cabin, I look forward to staying in a cabin. Most of all, I'm so happy that I could choose some activities. I'd like to practice golf and tennis. Both of them are my favorite sports and I'm quite good. I think I should ask you about something more. How's the weather there? Which kind of clothes  I have to bring and how much money I will need? Could you tell me about them? I'll be grateful if you could send me further information. I'll look forward to your reply.  Yours Sincerely  [SEP]  When I was asked what I do in my free time, I've never hesitated to say, ""I enjoy going shopping."" I'm very extroverted. So I like spend my energy doing sports or some kinds of energetic activity. I thought going shopping was suitable for me. Especially when I visit somewhere for the first time or I have nothing to do, but lots of time, I naturally and automatically look for a decent shopping centre. But nowadays I found shopping is not always enjoyable. Since I started living in England, I've worked two part time jobs as a cleaner. I can't make enough money for my living expense. I have to control my expenses on the budget. It's not easy for me, as I used to depend on my parents before I came here.  Anyway I must check and even compare the prices of different supermarkets. What makes me desperate is a nice summer dress I've found in a department store. I really wanted to buy it, but I couldn't afford to buy it. I realised that shopping is not always enjoyable. ",30.0
859," Dear Sir, Thank you very much for your nice letter which informed me   to have won first prize in my competition. I'am really surprising and happy about it. In your letter you needed  some informations about me. Unfortunately, I have only the possibility to travel in July because in August I will start a new job for six months. I won't be free, however all July I am at home. For accommodations at this camp, I would prefer being in a tent to being in a log cabin. It is more amusing and friendly. It will allow me to make friends more quickly. Two of my best activities are swimming and photography. The first one  is a needless for me. I go every day swimming  one Mile. The last summer I won a prize in competition of swimming. The second one is more  a hobby. I like go in nature and make photography. I started it two months ago. I don't have any material. Could you tell me if you would lend me some material for photography? What sort of clothes will I need for these two weeks? How much money will I take with me? I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely, Henri Devereux  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I'm so happy with the experience I lived last month. I told you that I have helped at a pop concert last month. I was really great. Firstly I was designed to sell the tickets. I was already happy to help in such a big concert than the Mylene Farmer's concert. I was starting to sell the tickets when a person who organised told me to go into the lodge. They needed one person for putting the clothes into a wardrobe. It was the lodge of Mylene Farmer. Are you thinking? I was so exciting! Unfortunately, I didn't see her but it allowed me to talk with her manager John and her musicians.  All were very kindly and pleasant. It was a big moment for me. Finally these people are like us, they have just a special job with special times. The next year, if it will be possible, I would like go back with you. They will organise a same concert pop but with an other singer. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Love, Henri ",23.0
805," Dear Sirs! First I want to thank you for all the congratulations, and I'll try to answer all your questions about for instance travel and accomodation. I have to tell you that for me it is only possible to go on holiday in July because my father is very ill and it is only possible for my sister to take care of him in July (because her small children are in summer school at this time. Another question was about the accommodation. I have to tell you that I'd prefer  tents. For me tents are a kind of back to basic living and I like this very much. In my opinion people should become more familiar with the rules of nature. I was very glad to read that it is possible to do activities at Camp California. I've chosen singing and swimming. Singing is one of my favourite activities and I know that I do it very well. I'm also used to sing in front of a large number of people 'couse I did it several times. I'm also good at swimming but I do not do it professional. There are two further questions which I have to ask you. First How much money do I have to take with me? and what clothes should I choose? I'd be very happy if you could give me a call and answer this questions. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Kim! Today I have to tell you something really exciting and also very hard to believe. Last month I received a letter which told me that I've entered a competition. I was so happy and suprised that I first could not really believe it.  But it was true. My price was the chance to meet a pop group and to help at the concert. The pop group which was going to act is called ""Metallica"" and I like their music very much ('cause in my opinion the music is a bit different from all the songs you usually listen to.) But now to the concert itself. It took place on the 10th of June in Salzburg. I started at 8 pm but I had to be there at 11 am. First I had to help with the catering which lasted until 2 pm. After this I met the band members and got to know them while we were having a good meal. The front man felt a bit sick and so he skipped the meal. I was so excited that I also was not able to eat anything. At 5 pm the band members disappeared again and I was responsible for some kind of guiding tour for the journalists. I had to show them the way to the interviewing room. It was a bit boring but more or less okay. At 7 p.m. the first group started. They were unknown and not very good but when I met them afterwards I recognised that they are very nice. At 8 pm Metallica started and I have to tell you, they did a great performance. When I met them after the concert they asked me questions like Did you like the performance! or How do you think about the first group? Questions like you and I usually ask each other. You know what I mean, they were not conceited or something like this. They were like any other person and I have to admit that I like them very much. This was one of the best and most exciting days in my life. Hope you answer this letter as soon as possible. Lots of hugs and kisses ",36.0

I am delighted that finally, I have won the first prise in your Competition. I would like to travel only in June because I will start working in July that means I will not be able to come there  later. Moreover, I would rather stay in a tent than in a log cabin because I always stay in a tent when I am on holidays. It is not comfortable but it still like it. Concerning to the activities which I have to choose I would like to inform you that I am fond of photography and I am quite good in it because I have attended a relevant course for three months. According to my work experience as a lifeguard I will choose swimming as the second activity. Could you please tell me what kind of clothes I have to bring with me? (like.. specific equipment or anything else). How much money do I need? I am looking forwards to hearing from you Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  ""Shopping is not always enjoyable"" Is it true or not? Some people agree with it, some people not. If you don't work and you have plenty of time going shopping is really enjoyable, because there are big shopping centres in which you can find so many different things. There are new products which you could not imagine that could be so interesting. Shopping is a good way to kill your time and some times you can not realize how fast the time goes. This happens because people enjoy themselves a lot. On the other hand there are some disadvantages. for example if you are a working mother with three children, that means you are always n a hurry, going shopping is really unenjoyable. You go shopping in a big supermarket because you know you will find everything there and you need 15 minutes to find the goods and 20 minutes to pay for them because of the big queue. You need to buy essential items like food and you get tired because it  very crowded and you spend more time thank you prefer to. In Conclusion shopping is enjoyable but not when it is too buzy. Otherwise If you are in a good mood it will turn into a bad mood. You should avoid the peak times. ",26.0

In answer to your questions, I will have to say that I just can go to the campament on July because of my job, they only gave me that month free. In the camp I would like to stay in  log cabins because I hate to sleep uncomfortable and, I will if I stay in a tent. Acording to your letter, you asked me to choose two of your activities. I  prefere to do some climbing because that's what I do in my spare time and I do it quite well. Apart from that, if you give surfing classes I would love to take them; surfing is one of my chilhood drems that I never came true. I have a few questions that you might be able to answer me.

Im looking forward to go to the camp and hearing from you soon Yours sincerely Carmen Garcia.  [SEP]  Shooping is not always enjoyable. We all have been shooping once in our lifes and sometimes it probably has not been very enjoyable, why? we had a class discussion and we all agree in some points. For example if we go to a big mall we will probably never find what we were looking for, and instead of buing what we came for we will go out with lots of things that we liked but we will never use. And that will be  waste of time. Sometimes we have to take our little brothers with us, because our mother isn't home, and then is where the problems begin. Most of the times one get lost, or they start plaing around, making noise, bothering people, etc... And when this happens you get on a bad mood and you'll have a bad shooping day. So if you want to have a good relaxing shooping day, we recommend you not to go with your little brothers and to go with enogh time to look arround for what you really want. ",26.0
100," Dear Mr Jones: I'm writting  you because I wanted to tell you what a bad experience I had during my holidays when I went to see the play on  your theatre. To begin with, the actor you publised was going to perform, didn't. To make things even worse, the play didn't start at 19:30 as it was supposed to but instead it started 45 minutes late, at 20:15, and there weren't even your famous discounts available. As it wasn't enough, after the show, I took the risk of going to your restaurant and  not very hard to guess  I wasn't able to enjoy it, as for it was closed because it wasn't clean enough to sell food, the perfect ending for the perfect evening. Considering all this, and especially the fact that I didn't get a discount on my ticket, I think the least you can do is give me my money back to make it up to me, and so I can go an spend the money in a good play when they do what they've promised. Waiting for your to write back Yours  [SEP]  Modern technology is, nowadays, not only a ""tool"" for every day life but also a lifestyle. People are getting more and more adicted to this, because  helps  every day life to be easier and more confortable. In my own personal experience, technology is something I can't live without. From a simple domestic appliance, a TV or a radio to a cell phone or a computer, my life is much better now than it was before. For example, whenever I go out by myself, my father gives me a cell phone, to call him in case I need anything. Another thing I depend on is the computer. Not only to play  or use the Internet, but also to write my papers for school. I think that anything that can make our lifes better, should be done, because that way we wouldn't have so many things to be concerned about, and we would be able to live a happier and more relaxed life.

Firstly, I'd like to travel in July because I've already resistered  another summer course which starts in the end of July. Sorry about that but I can make that travel only in July. About accomodation, I prefer in tents to log cabins. Because I haven't used tents for ages so this time, I want to have tents for 2 weeks which will remind me of my childhood with my family. I'm very keen on photography, especially while I'm staying in  Sates. I might have lots of chances to take photos of beautiful nature. So I'm longing to take part in that activity, photography. Actually I've been in  amature photographer's organization for 3 years. And I'd like to choose swimming as the other one. I learned swimming at my age of 8 for 5 years and I still love swimming. At that time, I took the course which covered all the 4 kinds of strocks. Finally, could you let me know how the weather is like in July in  States? Then I can prepare my clothes suitable for that weather. And please tell me how much money I am supposed to need excluding transport and accomodation. Thanks loads Yours sincerely Kyon Chwa  [SEP]  All the students in my class are excited about that work and now we're in the process of discussion about what will be filmed. Some students suggested very brilliant ideas. We've been thinking about the plot, at first, and we decided it would be the best way, the flow of time. The lessons we have in the morning doesn't attract us very much, but this bit will show you  routine scenery of a lesson. Spoken English lessons which is in the afternoon are quite interesting. Every  students keep talking about he theme and give their opinions. So we're going to organize about 10 minutes' short debate just for this video, but we haven't decided when it will be and the subject. After the class is also  very essential part of school life. Because we go to the pub which is situated near to the school quite often and we talk more about personal stories that make us closer, the pub after the lessons will be interesting. If you don't mind, we want to film  teachers' room as well. Your preperation for lessons, everyday chats and so on. If you allow us to film those things, we'll be very happy. When things become more obvious and more things are decided, I'll report again. ",31.0
473," Dear Sir, I'm writing this letter to you because I'm very disappointed and I believe you have to hang me some money back. Last week I was in London to see your new musical show. Before I bought my ticket and booked train and hotel reservations I'd read a lot  good reviews about that show and I thought it was a great moment to share with friends. But that evening became a real nightmare! Firstly your advertisement is a real lie. Discounts available?? False and not true! Then the show was late , we had been waiting for a long long time before it started. But finally it started.. and what!! Danny Brook wasn't on the stage! I saw a young actor who I've never seen  and who seemed not to know by heart his role! Shame on you! After that ""show"" we were starving and we had planned to eat in your theatre restaurand but what a surprise! It was closed (of course) and why? A general strike... It wasn't at all a perfect evening I'm not pleased. I would weep if I wasn't so angry. To summarize I want that you hang me my money back and very quickly. Your faithfully..  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed your daily life? Modern technology had changed  human being's daily life long before I was born. Nowadays according to me the most important revolution is connected with new technologies. Let's take the mobil phone. Our parents used the phone to make an important appointment. Nowadays everybody has got a phone which is ""mobil"". And I'm not different I've got one and it has changed my everyday life. I always can be reached, I can phone friends when I know I would be late and thanks to that appliance I feel less nervous and now I'm sure I couldn't live without it. It's the same with  Internet and that's a very new thing. I send and receive more mails than letters! I can chat with my sister or friends without speaking when I'm working because it take up just some minutes. With  Internet and according to me the world is become smaller and bigger at the same time. Smaller because I can visit an American library without leaving my desk and bigger because it seems to be endless. Yes my daily life has been changed and it's a good thing. ",32.0
966," 13th June 2000 Dear Edouard, Firstly, let me thank you for your nice letter of June 10th. I was so surprised but so glad to read that I won the first prize in your competition. In response to your question and if you don't mind, I would prefer to travel in July because I've already chosen my holiday and my boss won't give me another one. I would be grateful if I could accommodate in a log cabin. I'm no more a young girl! and do appreciate a little bit of comfort. As you asked me, my favourite activities would be painting and climbing. I like very much the moutains and would particularly enjoy painting them after a walk. Would you be so kind as to write  me as soon as possible because I need the accurate date of the journey. I've got four children and have to organise their time without  mother. Furthermore, I would like to know exactly which kind of clothes I have to take with  and how much money I'll be supposed to spend there. I'm really looking forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully, Edith-Marilyn Piaf  [SEP]  Shopping is  my everyday life. I'm a mother of four children and you can easily imagine how many things I have to buy in a week. It starts with food (monstruous) and goes on with clothes, pills, games and so on. It never ends! But unlikely to what you could think, I love shopping. I find it a very relaxing moment. At home, you have to work hard and you're often stressful because of your children  always asking you for something. When you're shopping, you can finally relax, just admiring what you're seeing. Your only work consist in choosing what suits you or buying what you prefer for dinner for instance; furthermore you're not disturbed: it's a dream! To be fair, I must say that I've noticed one disadvantage on shopping: you need money! You'll understand, I'm sure, that I prefer shopping at the beginning of every month. In order to change this situation I could win the lottery: a dream too! ",29.0
403," 16th November 2000 Dear Sir I'm writing to complain about an evening I spent in your theatre to see a musical show. According to your brochure, it was supposed to be the perfect evening out; instead of that I had a very disappointing evening. Firstly, the actors weren't those announced. Indeed, instead of Danny Brook and Tina Truelove; we had mean actors. As for the times, the show was supposed to begin at 19.30 whereas in reality it began at 20.15. Likewise, there were no discounts avalaible. To end, in spite of being opened, the restaurant was closed for reparations. Because of all those inconvenients, I ask you  a total refund. I'm sure you will accept my request; if not I intend to take legal actions against your company. You may contact me at my home address whenever you wish. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. So when Caroline, his girlfriend, told him something personal and very important; because she trusted in him; immediatly he came to see one of his friend to tell him the secret. When poor Caroline arrived at school on Wednesday morning all the students of her class knew about what she had just said the day before to Pat. So immediatly she went towards Pat, angry, in order to argue with him, saying that she was annoyed by the way he behaved, and that it wasn't the first time that he wasn't capable of keeping a secret. After a long conversation they eventually decided to split up. Because of his behaviour, now Pat is alone and nobody trust in him. ",26.0
1057," Dear Mr Robertson, At first, all the students and I would thank  you for this great idea of a trip in London during three days. The programme is very exating and interesting, especially the river trip to Greenwich. Otherwise, all the class have seen an advertisement for the ""London Fashion and Leisure Show"", and we are all interested  to see this show, this is why I am writing to you. In fact this is a great opportunity because we certainly will not have again the chance to take part in a live show, like this one. Even more, the students don't pay the entrance. The show is on the 14th from 10.00 to 19.00, so I suggest to go to the Science Museum on the afternoon of Wednesday, and just have two or three hours free time after the museum. This is the arrangement that we fouded with the other students and everyone had agree. I look forward to hear  news from you. Your Faithfull,  [SEP]  It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. The survive of my family depended on me. We were a poor family, living in one room for five persons. My father died during the war and my mother stayed alone with four children. We haven't enough money to buy food,  new clothes and the worse  was that my youngerst brother was terribly ill, and without money we couldn't bring him up to a doctor. So, a day I decided to steal the bank. During weeks, I had prepared my programme, trying not to forget something important. Everything was ready and me  too. So I knew that the day after would be the good one. I get up very early. All the city was sleeping. The weather was cold. When I arrived in front of the bank, my heart was going faster. A few days before, I had founded a little window at the back of the building, so I entered by this way and by chance I just arrived in the monney's room. I hadn't never seen so much money. I took it, the most of possible and went out by the same way. I ran to my house and went back in my bed for sleep a little bit. When all the family get up, I told us the true and  all promised to say nothing. It was our family's secret. ",24.00
862," 13 June 2000 Dear Ms. Ryan, I am very pleased to be the winer in your competition. I almost could not believe it when I received the letter you had sent. I have never won a prize like this. Thank you  indeed! I am working as a Mechanical Engineer for a well-known car company and I would like to travel in July because this the only month I can use my annual leave. During this exciting holiday I would prefer staying in a log cabin. The reason for this is that I have got a difficulty in sleeping in tents. When I was at the Univercity I was very keen on basket ball and I was playing in  Univercity's team. In 1998 we were the champion of the First National Leque. Also I am a quite good swimmer. I think that is because of my long legs. So I would love to join Basketball and Swimming activities while I am at the Camp. There is something I need to ask you; I don know exactly what is California's weather lime. What kind of clothes  I need to bring with me? Also, what is the currency in California and how much money  I need to take with me? I am looking forward to your reply! Yours sincerely   [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable. Novadays our shopping habits seem to be changed. I can clearly remember my childhood and our only local shop. Yes! There was only one shop in the area where I used to live until we moved to Oxford. I was really astonished by all these shopping centers like ASDA, HOMEBASE, ex. One day I decided to go to the shopping center which is only 40 meters from our house. Firstly, I could not find the entrance. I'd walked arround  about 15 minutes until I found the door. I realized that I'd walked so many times in front of the entrance but the door had looked like a window. When I entered into the shope I was a bit angry. I was holding a peace of paper which my mum gave to me. There were written all things I had to buy. But no way! I started looking for the food products written on the paper but I found only the eggs, milk and bread. Nothing else. So what was all that about?! I wasted 2 hours to buy food which you can find in every local shop. Later somebody told me that I had to look at the labels on the top. ",32.0
140," Dear sir, I'm writing to you to complain about the show presented by Circle Theatre last Tuesday. In fact it was quite different from the one I had expected to see. First of all, Danny Brook wasn't the leading actor, though his name was printed on the brochure. I had been looking forward to seeing his performance for ages, so as soon as I realized there was a substitute on the stage, I was really disappointed. I was angry because the show started at 20:15 instead of 19.30, too. Considering that I had to buy a full-price ticket (even if I had read on the brochure that discounts would be available), I think you can understand my anger. I suggest you should solve these problems quickly. If I were you, I should keep open the theatre restaurant, because I heard people saying it was a pity it was closed. Thanks to you, I've had the most dreadful experience of my life. If you don't give me back my money I'll never go to your theatre again. Write back soon  [SEP]  As Modern technology is changing the world rapidly I think we are all involved in the revolution it's causing. New technologies have affected people's way of living for ages, by offering them better tools  to survive I think people don't realize how much technology rules their life. Neither do I. In particular I'd like to talk about  Internet. I think that  Internet has changed my daily life most of all. In fact, now I can write to friends who live in foreign countries, for exemple in the morning and receive back their answer in the evening or even just a minute after writing. Therefore I regard  Internet as a quite powerful tool and I believe it has given more strenght to relations among people. In fact people meet on the Net; they learn many things; they stay in touch with friends who are abroad; and sometimes they even fall in love on the net. I can say such things because I use the net in the same way and I'm really astounded by its way  of changing my daily life. ",34.0
197," Dear Sir: I am writing to you this letter because I would like you to know about a musical show which I went to see to the Circle Theatre. First of all, I wanted to see this musical 'Over the Rainbow' because the actor Danny Brook was acting in it. But when the musical started I got very disappointed because Harry Smythe, a not very famous actor, was acting instead of Danny Brook. Then, the musical didn't start on time. It supposed to start at 19.30 pm in the evening but we had to wait for more than half an hour. All the people got very angry. Also I bought a £20 ticket because in the advertisement for the show was put that discounts were available for £10 £15, £20 tickets. I couldn't have my ticket discounted because when I went to buy it they told me that was untrue. Furthermore, in the advertisement was put that the theatre restaurant was opened but when we went there after the show, it was closed because the chief of the restaurant was ill. It was ridiculous! In conclusion, I didn't have my perfect evening out, in other words, I had a very disappointing evening so I am asking you for my money back. I would like to have my money back in ten days, in the other case, I would have to sue you. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. I'm telling you this because I had a big trouble a few days ago because of her. Pat used to be my best friend but a few days ago I knew all the truth. I used to tell Pat everything about myself - my problems with my parents, my problems with the school, friends and more. I was always talking to her and she was always listening to me but she didn't talk to me very much about herself. At first, I thought it was a bit strange but I didn't care too much about that and I easily forgot it. In other words, Pat knew all my secrets. I started to get along with other people and had new friends but I continued telling Pat my secrets. My new friends sometimes talked to me about Pat and they asked me once if we were close friends. I asked them why they had asked me that. Their answer surprised me too much. They told me Pat used to be a close friend of them and she used to talk about me and my problems. So, they had already knew all my secrets for a long time!  I got very angry and immediately I went to talk to Pat. At first, Pat denied all the things my friends told me about herself but she finally agreed with that. I asked her why she couldn't keep my secrets and she told me that it was impossible for her keeping secrets. She was very sorry about that and  few days after she moved in to another city and actually I don't know anything about her. I thanked my new friends for not to tell anybody my secrets  though before the trouble they and me weren't very  friends. Now I'm very happy with my new friends and I have learnt that I can't trust anybody too much because you don't really know how the person is like. ",33.0
397," Dear Sir Last week I attempted the musical ""Over the rainbow"", and I am writting in order to complaint about things that really disappointed me. First of all, I want to say that in the play  appeared a different actor  despite  that in the advertisement appeared the name of Danny Brook, that actor was very bad. Another thing I want to add is that the musical started 45 minutes late, it was planned to start at 19.30 and it really did it at 20:15. During this time we had to keep seating in the theatre and it was boring and tiring. Thirdly, when I bought the tickets, I asked for discounts and nobody know anything about them, so it is false  there are discounts available. However, we enjoyed the musical, but while going out to have dinner, we saw the restaurant  closed and we had to take the car and come back home very hungry. It was a very disappointing evening and I hope you will give us some money back. I am waiting for your answer. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Hello. I'm Robert and I'm writting for the article about clothes in the future. In my oppinion, in a hundred of years, we'll wear the same kind of clothes that we wear nowadays. What will change in clothes, will be the comfortability of them and the way they protect us and our body from temperature and physical agressions. I think they will cold us in the summer and makes us hot in the winter. Clothes will be more personalized and they'll make us feel better and more free. Wearing them we'll be able to dive underwater with a high pressure, and we'll have freedom of movement. Technology will take  part in clothes development, scientists will search the way to reduce the weight of clothes and they will become very light and comfortable, so I want to be in the future to enjoy the clothes. I wish I win the trip! ",25.0
361," Dear Sir! I am writing to you because of the musical show ""Over The Rainbow"" I saw in your theatre last week. I looked forward  a perfect evening but it was the most disappointing one I have ever had. Firstly, you did not tell the truth about  starring. The advertisement of the musical said that it was going to be Danny Brook, unfortunately there was someone else - an actor which I do not like and if I have known that he was going to be  I woud not have come to see him. Secondly, it was supposed to start at 19.30 but  actually started at 20.15. Forty five minutes later! You also have mentioned about the discounts and there were not any. Lastly, the restaurant which was going to be opened was in fact closed without a reason ! Keeping in mind all these arguments, I want to ask you for some money back. I think it could be your nice apologise for all my problems and disappointments. Your faithfuly,  [SEP]  Contemporary modern technology is a very important aspect of our lives. It is always with us: in our homes, in the places we work and learn. It affects our lifes, my too. In fact modern technology was already very popular and comonly used when I was born, so I cannot say that it changed my life rapidly. But I am also sure, that my life would be different without it. All these products of science are with me since the very beging of my day. For example I am woken up by my electronic alarm-clock, then I go to the bathroom and there is hot and cold water, next I eat my breakfast and listen to the radio. All these things are the ideas of the technology. On the other hand, I am aware of all these disadvantages of the modern technology; pollution and  dangarous it brings. But I think it has more advantages than disadvantages and it is O.K. I am really glad that I am a child of my centuary - the age of modern science. Finally, I think that we cannot talk only about  changes which the modern technology has brought to our lives. That's because that I think that we are the one who change the technology as well. I think that our lives are lives with technology, they sometimes mean the same as science and affects not on at each other but together. So how has the modern technology changed my daily life? I don't know how it would be like without the technology. ",30.0
118," Dear Sir, I would like to show you how disappointed I am about the musical show you manage. As I had a whole week holiday I decided to spend it in London. At first I though I would just make a bit of sight-seeking all around the city. But when one night I saw your advertisement I decided to spend my last night in the city watching a musical show. No sooner had I seen  the starring actor  than I couldn't believe it. Danny Brook was one of my best friends while I was at University. But as the show began, I realised that the actor was someone different, his name was Tim Paradise. If this had been my only disappointment nothing would have happened, but I had to wait stil quarter past eight in order to watch the show, instead of  beggining at half past seven as you had written in your advertisement. Although I found the tickets's prize too much expensive I though that there would be some discounts available, but there were not. As a conclution of that horrible evening I decided to visit your theatre restaurant once the show had finished, but what a surprise when I found it closed. For all of these reasons I have to ask you for having  my money back. Sincerely: a disappointed user!  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. All began when I decided to take part in that school project. It consisted in having to memorisize a whole book of 250 pages in order to pass a final exam. Although this project could seem a very though work, I had to try it in order to rise my low global mark. One day as I was talking with my teacher about the project I saw what it could be the final answer sheet  exam on the top of his desk. Suddenly, when the teacher went out of his office, I quickly copied the answers on my notebook, I couldn't believe it, that would be the easiest exam I would had ever done. As I went out of the office I found walking down the corridor Pat, my best friend. As she was also making the project I decided to let her copy the answers. I told her she hadn't to talk about that to anybody. She agreed and went home very happy. When night came I couldn't believe what was happening. Almost all my class mates were in the front door of my house asking me if I had the solutions of the exam. I couldn't believe that my best friend had told everybody about my secret. In the exam day everybody anwered correctly to each question. And after having corrected all of them, our teacher told us we had to repeat the exam because he realised we knew what the answers were. It was the last time I trusted in Pat. ",30.0
7," Dear Jane Clark, I am writing to you to give  some opinions of mine abut The International Arts Festival. It was a great idea and I had the pleasure of resting and relaxing, plus of getting some important knowledge from it. On the other hand there were some disadvantages: 1. Stars and artists wee only from six countries 2. Some concert halls were too small. So it was impossible to get tickets there. 3. I think that there were not enough plays and films. To sum up I want to tell you bout my suggestions for next year's festival. It would be wonderful to buy some books or programms with  signatures of all the stars and artists taking part in the festival. Also I think that  dance shows should include different styles of dancing (e.g.  national dancing of all the countries) to impress  audience and not to bore with the similar scenes. I hope this letter will help you in organying  Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Hello Philip, I have just got your letter. It is a pleasure for me to communicate with such a friend as you are.

One should have such marks as ,,3"", ,,4"", ,,5"" not ,,2"" which is eaqual to fail. 3. Another strict rule is not to be late for your lessons. Otherwise you are not allowed to come in. These rules are strict and certainly we have  endless number of just-so-called rules. I don't think you will be interested in them. Truely speaking I am not sure about home rules.

936," Dear Mrs. Helen Ryan. It was so great to hear that I had won first prize. It would be meaningful in my life to take part in your camp. I am writing to reply about your questions. I am wondering that I will be only able to travel in July, because I have to finish my first year at the university. It finishes 29th of June. In addition to this, I have already resistered  another course which starts from 2nd of August. Secondly, I would prefer living in tents, I always admire outdoors life. Finally, I would like to  surging and golf. In  case of surfing, I have never had an experience, I am  absolutely beginner. On the other hand, I used to play golf with my father.

You are working with your idea woman, I can't still belive that I spoke with her. Anyway, the most important thing was that I had  good experience. If we had worked together we would have had a good time. It's   pity, isn't it?

773," Dear Mrs Helen Ryan, I am writing to you about the first prize I won in your competition. I am very pleased and I include the information you asked for. I prefer travelling in July because I am taking some important exams in September and I have planned to study in August. With reference to the accomodation I would rather stay in  tent because I think it is the best way to socialize. For what concernes the activities I think that swimming and climbing are the most suitable for me. I have been swimming since I was three and I did a lot of courses. On the other hand I have never had a course of climbing even though I would like to take up this hobby. I would like to ask you something about the weather and clothes I should bring  not to have to buy anything there. In addition I need to know whether meals are included or not in the accomodation so that I could decide how much I must have with me. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely, Mafalda D'Accatino  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I bet you want to know everything about my great experience at Luna Pop's concert last month. Before that I had never thought I would play with a famous group. But maybe you want to hear the story from the beginning. As you know Luna Pop is not my favourite group and I went to their concert only because Ake needed being accompanied. When we arrived she persuaded me to go the backstage because her boyfriend was the electrician of the band. It didn't sound very exciting to me but I accepted above all because I was curious. Unfortunately what I found wasn't what I expected. Everyone was upset, worried or angry and Lucre, Ake's boyfriend, explained that it was because their pianist had broken his arm and couldn't play.  In that moment Ake exlaimed that I could play the piano. After that I tried to tell them I had just begun  but within five minutes I was on the stage and I was playing that, luckily, easy tune. I think you can't believe in what I've told you but I won't forget this experience. This has been the first time I have realized that, maybe, playing the piano could be my future and, even though I was really frightened, I enjoyed staying on the stage with all those eyes on me. I wish you had been with me but I'm sure you understand what I felt. Love Mafalda ",35.0
578," Dear Mrs Ryan, Thank you for your letter. I am very pleased to see that I win the first prize in your competition. I am going to answer your questions. Firstly, I would like to travel on July because I have some holidays during this month. I am working the rest of this summer. For the accommodation, I would prefer to stay in a log cabin because I think it is probably more comfortable. I think we are going to be tired so I prefer to sleep comfortably. You also asked me about two activities. I choose singing because I love singing and I am in a choir for 7 years now. I also choose climbing. Unfortunately I am not so good in it. But I would take the opportunity to improve myself. In addition, I have some questions. I would like to know which sort of clothes we have to take with us and also how much money is necessary. I look forward to hearing from you in the near future. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable Our life of today is getting even more about consommation. You always find more shops and they are open even more late. You can't live without shopping but shopping is not always enjoyable. Firstly, if you try to do your shopping during the rush hour, it could be very difficult. Everybody is stressed, you have to make the queue. It is not comfortable at all. In addition, everything is now so expensive that you have to compare the prices. You have to find which shop offers you good quality products for a good price. But sometimes some goods are expensive but of a very bad quality. And it is not an easy task if you have to complain about the quality. Most of the time the shop assistant doesn't believe you. In conclusion, I can say that shopping is not the most enjoyable task you could find. Of course you also have some good aspects but most of the time it is very unpleasant. You could try to do your shopping via  Internet. Perhaps you will find  less inconvenience. ",35.0
455," Dear Sir, I've been recently to one of yours musical shows called ""Over the rainbow"" in the Circle theatre in London thinking it might be a good idea but it was desappointing. I'm writting this letter to explain  you what had happened and look for a solution. To begin, the organitzation of your collegues of the theatre was awful becouse of diferents problems. Despite saying it will start at 19:30, it done at 20:15 which I think is to much late for a good theatre like yours. After, you say in the advertisement  to visit your restaurant, however it was close, how can you explain that? Secondly, there were some false information in your advertisement that made me angry. You say it would be Danny brook the man who was going to sing but it wasn't. And to sum up, there weren't  discounts on the prices of the tickets. For all of that, I want my money back, at least 15 of the 20 pounds I'd paid. Looking for forward  hearing from you. Your faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, so without want I knew that it was going to be a concert on owr city  of, from my point of view, the best group of the world, Oasis. And she had planned with my friends went there without me. At first I got angry with Pat more than with the others friends of the group, becouse Pat was and is my best friend. However, a couple of minutes later, I calmed down and asked she why. She answered to me becouse all this year I have been so irritated that I got angry with every person who tried to talk to me, and the others friend had convinced her to let me out. The I realised that she got reason, I was irritated becouse my parent was going to  divorce, but Pat would always be my best friend so I told her that I wasn't angry with her and I was not going to go to the concert becouse I had to go to the court to solve my parent's affair. I asked her to look photos of Oasis for me and she accepted. If Pat had been good at keeping secrets, I wouldn't have known anything about the concert and I wouldn't have got angry for not being able to go. And that's the history of how I lose the oportunity to go to the only concert that Oasis had done in my city. ",20.0
626," Dear Helen: Thank you for sending me this wonderful news. I was really happy when I knew I won the first prize. I am writing to give you my details and ask  some more information. Firstly, I would like to travel in July because I need to stay at home in August. I am a college student and I am going to study in university this year. I will take my exams in June and have the result in August. So I shall stay to prepare for my university. Secondly, I prefer staying in log cabins so that I can have more chance to be with other people, then I can make more friends. During the camp, I will do sing and climbing activities. I enjoy singing all the time and I want to share my music with the others. I also like climbing because I like the view on the top of hills. Finaly, I want to know what the weather is like in California in July. Do I need some special clothes for the camp and how much money shall I bring for other expenses. I am looking forward to hear from you. Yours Sincerely.  [SEP]  To: The teacher of  English class From: Jolin Subject: The lessons  should be filmed Date: 13, June, 00 Instruction:  English class is going to make a short video about  school daily life. The aim of this report is to give the suggestion of which lessons and activities should be filmed. Lessons and Activities  Speaking and Listening class should be filmed because the purpose of this class is to encourage students talk about some topics they choose and discuss  with others in order to prove their speaking and listening skills. Topical class is similar to speaking and listening but the materials are more up-dated. The teacher use video,  pictures to show students about festivals, sports, museums, ect. It is popular by the students. Canteen is the place students stay together apart from class. Quite a lot of students spend their free time there for relaxing and talking. Basketball is the most popular activity, whick takes place between 4:30 pm - 6:30 pm from Monday to Friday every week. Not only the students who have activity play but also a lot of students watch. Conclusion The lessons and activities above are the suggestion should be filmed. ",27.0
1213," Dear Mrs Maria Smith, Thank you for your letter. I am writing to answering our question. Firstly, I already have booked  Palace Hotel for the students. There is the hotel near my college. It takes five minutes to get  my college by walking. I will copy the map around the college. Secondly, I will tell you about the end-of-conference party. It will start at six o'clock. The party will be held in the dinning room. People who will attend the party are many professers, semi-professers and faculties. So I suggest that the students should wear formal clothes. Finally, I will give you some ideas for an afternoon free time. The city in which there is my college is traditional in my country. For example, there are many shrines, temples, and castles. I suggest that you should visit these places. You will have a good time. In addition, there are many other colleges. You will be able to see many Japanese students. I am looking forward to seeing you at the conference. If you would like to gain more information, you will ask me everytime. Yours sincerely.  [SEP]  I suggest that you should visit one building. My town is the capital of Japan. So there are many higher buildings. I think it is like New York. However, I have only one building which I want you to visit. The name of the building is 'Sunshine 60'. This is the highest building in Tokyo. I recommend to visit . I have three reasons for my recommendation. Firstly, there is the acquerium in the building. In addition, this is the 60th floor,  I went there  first time I couldn't believed it. Secondly, if you visit there, you will see everywhere in Tokyo. The scene of Tokyo is not beautiful, but you think that this city is a developing place. On the other hand you may think what a small city it is!! Finally, there are many shops inside the building. You will have a good time for shopping. I hope when you visit, you will be favorite place. You should visit there. ",24.00
290," MR. MANAGER, I'M WRITING  YOU TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE MUSICAL SHOW ""OVER THE RAINBOW"" WICH WAS PRESENTED LAST WEEK. YOUR ADVERTISING LEAFLET WAS COMPLETELY WRONG, IT SAID THAT DANNY BROOK WAS ACTING BUT, WHEN I GOT THERE, THERE WAS ANOTHER GUY ON STAGE. IT WAS DISAPPOINTING, SPECIALLY FOR ME WHO IS A GREAT FAN OF DENNY. THAT'S NOT ALL! IT STARTED FORTY-FIVE MINUTES AFTER THE RIGHT TIME AND WE HAD TO WAIT OUTSIDE THE THEATRE. THE TICKETS WERE SUPPOSED TO HAVE DISCOUNTS BUT THE LADY WHO WAS SELLING  TOLD ME THAT I MUST BE WRONG, THEY NEVER GIVE ANY DISCOUNTS TO ANYONE. AFTER THE SHOW, I WENT TO VISIT YOUR RESTAURANT AS SUGGESTED ON THE ADVERTISEMENT BUT WHEN I GOT THERE IT WAS CLOSED. ONE OF THE EMPLOYEES OF THE THEATRE TOLD ME THAT IT WAS BECAUSE THEY WERE CLEANING IT TO GET RID OF THE RATS. I'VE NOT IMPRESSED WHEN HE TOLD ME THIS. FOR ALL THIS REASONS MY EVENING WAS TERRIBLE AND I WOULD LIKE TO RECEIVE AT LEAST PART OF MY MONEY BACK. YOURS SINCEARLY  [SEP]  SINCE I WAS BORN, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY ARE DEVELOPING FASTER AND FASTER, JUST AS EXAMPLE,  INTERNET GETS HUNDREDS OF NEW USERS EVERY SINGLE DAY. THIS TECHNOLOGY CHANGED OUR LIFE IN MANY WAYS AND WE ALMOST DON'T NOTICE IT. IN MY CASE, I'M COMPLETELY INTEGRATED WITH THEM,  ALMOST EVERYTHING I DO I USE THIS TECHNOLOGY. WHEN I WAS YOUNGER I USED TO READ BOOKS, WRITE, LISTEN TO THE RADIO AND, NOWADAYS, YOU CAN DO ALL THIS THINGS USING A COMPUTER. IT'S ONE OF THE MOST USEFUL TOOLS THAT MEN INVENTED IT'S POSSIBLE TO DO LOT'S OF THINGS AND TALK TO OTHER PEOPLE TOO USING A PC. MOST OF MY DAY I SPEND IN FRONT OF ONE OF THOSE MACHINES, STUDYING, RESEARCHING, PLAYING AND TALKING TO FRIENDS ALL AROUND THE WORLD. THIS TECHNOLOGY HAS ALSO IT'S BAD ASPECT, IT MAKES YOU MORE FAR FROM PEOPLE,  ISOLATED FROM TRUE RELATIONSHIPS BUT YOU CAN HANDLE IT WHEN YOU GOT USED TO THIS. ",31.0
1240," Dear Mrs Maria Smith, Thank you for your letter. I am writing to give you some advice of an international student conference. First of all, the name of  hotel which we have been booked into is  Palace Hotel. And we have two choices to get to the conference, a bus or a train. Both of them are as convinience as getting there. The day before we will leave there, we have a party which takes place in our hotel. It is a kind of formal party, so we should be well-dressed. I suggest that you wear a formal dress. There is some finger foods and drinks. It might be a great party for  end of  conference. End of all, in my opinion we could go  a center of the town because there is many places to have a look  and go shopping. It's quite a nice  and a suitable place to spend for three hours. It could be interesting for them. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Imagine our life without a telephone. If a telephone haven't been invented, we wouldn't have lived perfectly like nowadays. Wouldn't you think we rely on it more than we expect? A telephone is used when we need to contact with someone, and also an emergency situation and  an internet. It has various way to use, however, nowadays it is not only used by these purpose, but also it keeps our company. Even if you feel alone, you can talk and hear from your friend easily. Then it makes you happy. Long time ago people lived without this perfect invention. But how? They used to keep in touch with someone with a letter. In spite of taking a lot of time to catch up with, it was a only way. So that's why they have invented a telephon. Now we could feel the world closer and closer beaus of a telephone. Who wouldn't  thank for this great invention? ",23.00
1004," Dear Helen Ryan, I would like to thank you for your letter! I went in for your competition and I was really anxious about the results. I am surprised that I won the first prize but also very happy about it! Therefore it would be my pleasure to reply to your letter. Firstly, I would like to arrive at the Camp in July if that is possible because I am working and I will not have spare time before this month. Secondly, you are mentioning ""tents or log cabins"" as the accommodation provided. I would rather live in a tent than a log cabin in order to be close to nature I adore the sound of the wind, trees, animals and everything which is surrounding . I could feel the environment. Thirdly, as far as the activities I have to choose, I would prefer swimming as well as tennis. I have gained some experience in playing tennis due to the tennis court that we used to have at home. I do sports a lot so apart from  tennis I am a member in our local swimming centre. I can reasure you that gradually I am improving my sports skills. Finally, I would like to ask you which kind of clothes do I have to bring with me. Is the weather changeable? I was also wondering if I will need any money. I would appreciate  if you could let me know as soon as possible. I hope the information given will be of use. I have tried to be as helpful as possible. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I am writing to you about my previous experience. I know how impatient you are  about it and I just want to let you know that it was something amazing! As I've told you, last month I went at a pop concert and I really enjoy helping with the preparation. It took place in a huge stadium which had over 4.000 seats for the ""spactetors"" if you can call them like this. Can you imagine? There was a large stage which we had to clean by sweeping. That was a little bit odd but and funny at the same time. Another thing we had to do was help the staff to tranfer some equipment. The musicians brough it in order to achieve a high standard of quality sound. We had to be very careful. Have you any idea how much does this stuff  worth? You don't even want to know. Apart from these we were mainly helping the singers to be prepared for the concert. They had to chose their clothes,  give one last performance before the big night and everything had to be perfect! Even if I could use 100 sheets it wouldn't be enough to describe my experience and the things that I've gained through it! I've learned the meaning of the words ""reliability"" and ""responsibility"". Anyway the result of the whole preparation is  far more enjoyable and relaxing. Looking forward to hearing from you. Best wishes ",34.0
315," Dear Sir, I am writing to complain about the musical show ""Over the Rainbow"" I went to see at your theatre in London two weeks ago. According to your advertisement, Danny Brook was involved in the show, but to my disappointment there was a different actor. To make things worse, the show started at 20.15 instead of 19.30. Besides, there was a problem with tickets. According to the advertisement, discounts were available, but in reality it wasn't so! On top of everything, when I decided to visit your theatre restaurant after the show, it turned out to be closed. When I insisted on the explanation of this fact, I was told that the chief cook was on holiday! The perfect evening out you promised to provide turned  to be really boring and disappointing. In connection with this I think you should give me some money back. I hope you will  note  this and I look forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Pat was my classmate and I should add, that he was one of my best friends. I loved and respected him very much, but there was an unpleasant thing about him - he talked too much. My sister's birthday was coming. Her friends and I decided to present her with the thing she had been dreaming of for a long time - a puppy. We knew it would be a great present and she would be extremely happy. But the most important thing was that it would be really surprising to her, because she could hardly ever think of such a present. We bought a beautiful puppy and were waiting for the holiday probably even more impatiently, than Susie. But unfortunately Pat didn't manage to keep our secret. He told her about the present as soon as he saw her. I'm sure he did it not because he wanted to spoil everything, but because he was so happy and excited, that he couldn't act in a different way. Susie liked the puppy very much, her eyes were shining, but  friends were a little bit sad and disappointed, because they were expecting a completely different ending. ",35.0
728," Dear Ms Ryan, I was so surprised and delighted as well receiving from you such wonderful news! Thanks the God, you did me really happy. From your letter I was pleased to know that all accommodation and travel costs are paid for. But could you, please, let me have more details about my award. What kind of people will be invited at your Camp in this summer? I would like to know with whome I'll share sach a wonderful days with the sport activities. About sport... I must be honest: I'm not very keen on sport. But I will be glad to  swimming and sailing for some weeks. I have been learnt to paint. And I would prefer to have a nice audience for my poetry as well, I'm a poet, yeas. I would be choose a month  July, because I'm free in this time from family's duties. What about another camp conditions - it does not matter for me. I can stay in tents or log cabins, how you wish. Sent me, please, news about July. Yours sincerely Fu-Su Harp  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I hope that you  still OK and now are preparing for me a new nice letter! I hope so! I have been written to you that my life in London was a little bit boring for me. It was true. But now all things became absolutly changed! I found the kind of activity what I looking for four ages. My Russian friend ivited me to set up a new exiting business. We established a firm which has a deal with musicians and contemporary pop stars. Can you imagine! First of all, in order of our firm purpose I wrote an inventation to my favorite idol - a poet and a singer Boris Grebenchekoff. We were renting for him a special hall near Piccadilly Circus. The hall was crowded. His one-week concert programme was so succsessful that we decided to invite him else, as soon as  tickets would be  sold. I had a nice expirience as manager too. I would like to be a professional in this stage, yeas. Do you share my idea, Kim? Is not it a brilliant idea? You know, Kim, I'm always looking for purpose of human being. Not only - to LIVE, but to have something to LIVE FOR. Now I did my choice. Good luck to you as well! P.S. Your present, a small toy, a white hose - I always keep with me, it helps me to pass my exams. With Love - ",20.0
2," Dear Jane, I have read the advertisement for the festival and I must say it is a great idea. I would like to tell you some suggestions. The stars and artist are from only six countries, and some concerts take place in small halls. I think you should put it in the advertisement. Are there going to be more plays and films next year? I find the reasonably-priced ticket excellent, because there is a lot of people who went to see only one or two events, and by paying  the all events ticket they might see other events and learn about something they didn't expected to find interesting. I would like you to answer my letter. I'm looking forward to hearing from you,  [SEP]  Dear John, Here in Brazil the rules at school depends on the school. In general, the rules at private schools are much harder than the ones at state schools. In mine, we didn't have many rules. For example, nobody said anything when we smoked in the garden or in the bathroom. We were allowed to go out if we didn't want to stay in class. But we had to use the uniform and we had to study a lot to pass the exams. the rules at home are very different. I am allowed to do what I want as long as I studie enough to aprove. I think that my parents let me do what I want, because they trust me. they know that if I go out with the car, I will not drink. It is not allways easy, but there are rules in every home and you have to respect them. I am looking forward to hearing from you, ",25.00
690," 13 June 2000 Dear Helen Ryan, According to your letter, I am writing to infrom you about the information you need to know for my trip two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. I am very excited and looking forward to the new experiance I am going to have. First of all I must tell you that I only have freetime in July   at any day, any week, because I am still having my lesson at college and it will be finished at the end of June and also in August I have a training course for my studies. I would prefer to stay in tents because I love  atmosephere of camping, but I wouldn't mind to stay in log cabins. For the two activities I can choose, I would like to have swimming and Basketball. I have always found these kind of activity make me fell strong and  enjoy doing it. I first started playing basketball and swimming when I was aged 9, and I have been doing it up till now. I also used to be in a basketball team in school for 3 years. One thing, I would like to know is how many clothes I have to take with me and what kind of cloth they are? I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely, Vanida Montri  [SEP]  Report on daily life at school Introduction The aim of this report is describ and assess  lesson and activities should be filmed in a short video. It is base on information made availble by student from each class at school. Lessons Most student who were interviewed suggested to have a speaking part of the lesson  to be on film. It seemed to be the most interesting lesson, because student always make some mistake while they are practising with thier partner, in spite of having told from  teacher ten times. It felt to be a good memory to be remember and remind our sleves to speak in a correct way. This lesson will give us to be relaxed and have  laugh. We also would like to have a history on. Activities Going out to visit the history town every weekend seem to be the most enjoyable activity for student. Spending time together out of the class is the nice experiance. Having a sport after class it also fun. Conclusion Lesson and activities, which most student suggested are very interesting and it is not seem to be boring for the student. ",24.0
714," Dear Ms. Ryan, Thank you very much for your letter with reference to the competition. Here are the information you required. Firstly, I would like to travel in July, because it is the only month that I am free. Secondly, I prefer cabins. The main reason is that I love wood. In addition, due to my height (185 cm), I think cabins may be a better choice. Thirdly, from the activity list, I chose swimming and tennis as my favourite ones. Although I have played tennis only twice, I really enjoyed it. With contrast to this , I can swim when I was six. Furthermore, I once have been trained in a swimming centre, so I am quite confident with it. Lastly, could you please tell me what kind of clothes and how much money I should prepare and do I have to buy insurance myself? I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  The aim of this report is to suggest lessons and some activities which should be filmed in the video from my school. In my opinion, maths, politics, chinese, English and painting lessons are the most interesting ones. They are also the lessons which English  and other foreigners are particularlly curious in. As far as I know, English people are really surprised about  Chinese students' advanced level in Maths, as well as the knowledge in politics. This is a good oppertunate to see how they learn in class. As it is expected, painting lesson is an amazing one. You can find students use traditional chinese ink to draw and write. In spite of lessons, there are all kind of activities such as sports meeting, racing competition, and countryside activities. Some are held once a year and some are held every term. You will experience a different life in them. In conclusion, besides all  mentioned, I highly recommond you video  students' daily life and interview them. That will make it defenitely a successful video. ",26.0
8," Dear Clark, I am writing to you because I would like to give my personal opinion about the 'international arts festival.' First of all I have to say that the whole festival was a greatful success and I also think you chose an appropriate title for the leaflet. However, there are some points which can be improved for the next year. To begin with, you wrote down in the leaflet that stars and artists from around the world could be seen in the performance in fact their were only six countries involved. My suggestion for this point is to invite more people from different countries. Furthermore is that some concert halls were definitely to small or in other words to many people attended those concerts. This kind of problem you could avoid when you look for big halls at the begining. Another point where you could improve is when you show more plays and films next year. Nearly at the end of this letter I have to say that the idea with the weekend ticket was really good because it gave to the people the opportunity to attemp  a whole weekend for a cheap price. To finish this letter with I would like to give you a good idea for next year. In my opinion it would be nice if you create an exhibition place where the guests can try to play different instruments. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  How can you earn money in your spare time? I think everybody will ask himself this question one day or has already asked it. Anyway the people where asked this question probably found out that it isn't so easy to earn money or that it is sometimes to much work. A traditional way to earn money, in the spare time, is to bring newspapers or magazines to the families in your town or village. The problems that you have here is the weather. For example when it is rainy, because then everything get wet. Another suggestion is that you go to your cinema and ask if they need your help for changing the film rolls, for cleaning the toilets or to do some other small jobs. But in the case that you really want to do some interesting work in your spare time you should try to sell something where you're good at, I mean if you're interested in computers you should try to provide your service for other people. Of course in the begining it is hard but you can learn a lot and if you're good at  you'll also earn some money. Okay don't wait, there where you're good at and begin. ",34.00
944," Dear Mrs Ryan, I am writing to provide you with the information you require. First of all, I want to inform you that I would like to travel only in July, because in California at that time of the year  is very hot and I prefer going on summer to going on winter or during  other season, because I can do lots of activities that in winter  would be impossible to do. Secondly, I would rather be accomodationed in  log cabins than go in  tens. In my opinion staying in log cabins is funnier and much cleaner. Thirsthly, I would prefer to swimming and playing tennis, because I have been practising them since I was I child, and I think I  very good in each other. Finally, I would like to ask you if I have to take some money, or  everything is provided for the organisers. Furthermore, I would be grateful if you could tell me what type of clothes I have to take. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Kim, Sorry for not writing  you before, but I have been so busy, because last weak I went to a pop concert to help the singers. First, when I arrived they told me to go to a big room, where the singers try on their clothes and they are made-up. There, in the room I had to helped them, I mean the singers, to put on theirs clothes, and I had to  make-up  them. A few minutes later the show started and the grup appeared on the stage. While they were singing a man told me to clean the room, where the singers get dressed. Later, when the show had finished, I stayed with the grup in their room for a few minutes. Then, they went to the airport, and my dream finished. What I really liked doing was to helped them with their clothes and to make-up them, because I learnt how to  make-up a person and I spend a few minutes with the most popular grup of the world.

First of all, I would like to thank the jury for chosen my work from all the competitors. Next, I would like to find out some details about the camp. I need to know if my travel will take place in August. If I had known that I won, I would not have arranged my english course in Britain. Before. The next point is the accommodation. You mentioned that it will be in tents or log cabins. I would prefer staying in tents. I am very close to the nature, so it will be a pleasure for me. What's more, your letter said about the chance to do for two acctivities during the camp. I am very interested in tennis, but I am also very good at photography. It has been my hobby since I was a child. I have even won  competion once. That is why I would like to continue doing this at the camp. Finally, I would like to ask about other things like: clothes, money, guide. I would like to know if the ,,travel costs'' which you had paid for include entrance tickets to the museums' or any other cultural places, because I would like to  some sightseeing in the U.S.A. Furthermore, if there will be cmy tumple dryer or washing maschine to clean our clothes and if there will be a guide who will be responsible for us and the camp. I am looking forward to hearing from you Yours sincerely A. Adamski.  [SEP]  Generally, most people like shopping, but there are some advantages and disadvantages. When discribing the advantages, we should remember that most people like doing shopping. It is very pleasant when you are looking for something special or for special occasions like wedding, birthday,  Christmas presents. Next, it can be very good for your wallet to save some money, when you will find a bargain or sales. As well as that, some shop-assistance can give you a lower price, because you always do shopping at their shop. What is more, most people cannot live without shopping. It is their way to spend free time. On the other hand, there are some minuses. On top of that, shopping is very tiring and exhausting. Walking from shop to shop carrying heavy bags, takes much of your time. Instead of that you could do more interesting things. such as playing sports or reading a book. Besides that, shopping steal you from money. Very often people go to a shop - usually a big departament store and buy things which they do not need. In my opinion shopping is very tiring and I usually try to avoid doing it. When I have to, I do it, but I think we waste too much time on it that we should. On balance some people still like shopping even if it is not always enjoyable and they have to stand in a long queue to buy something. From my point of view it depands on us if shopping will be enjoyable or not. ",27.0
724," Dear Helen, I am writing to answer your letter, which I have recieved yesterday. First of all, I would like to thank you for accepting me and I am very appreciate that all costs are paid for. I could travel only in July because my exam will be finished in the beginning of that month and it would be great if I could set off  my journey on 15th July. I would prefer to stay in log cabins because the weather is going to be rainy according to the forecast. Therefore, I have chosen golf and tennis from the list. I have been playing them for more than 3 years in which I have been trained, 3 years for tennis, 1 year for golf by the professional coaches. I'm enjoy playing both of them regularly. In addition, it would be nice if you could send me an address  which I am going to stay, so that I can keep in touch with my friends and family. Finally, thank you again for everything and I am looking forward to accompanying you soon. Yours Sincerely,  [SEP]  ""Shopping is not always enjoyable"". I think this statement is true. In my opinion, shopping is not suitable for children whose age is under 18! This is quite a strong opinion , but I know it from my real-life experiences of shopping. When I was 15, I was starting to look for new clothes, shoes, and everything I could find now unneccessary. I'm not dare to culculate how much I have spent for those things without thinking. However, it was not bad, my mom always told me that I hadn't have earned enough money so that I shouldn't have spent it in the wrong way. Therefore, people who is over 18 can think of more reasons than young children  for shopping and buying such tempting objects. To sum up, shopping is not a wrong thing to do as long as you can earn money yourself and know what you are spending it for! ",31.0

I am really excited to travel at Camp California in the USA because I like to know people of other countries. As I only have holidays on July I would like to travel on this month. I would prefer to have accommodation in  log cabins because I like to be comfortable and I don't like to be lied down on the floor inside a tent. I would like to play basketball because I love this game. I used to play when I was at high school. I think that I am a very competitive player, as well or a  technical player. Also I would like to do swimming. I think that I am  very fast swimming but I don't have good style and technic.

As you know I love irish music so I was very happy when the organisers of the concert phone me to help them. The organisers paid for my acommodation and travel to Ireland. I arrived at Ireland on 2th July. On my first day I didn't work. On the next day I helped them to built the scenary and I had enough time to visit a museum in Dublin in the evening. On my third day I helped them to install the sound system. While we were installing the sound system we listened  irish music and suddenly we saw to U2, which is my favourite group, going inside the stadium and they played music for us. I could speak to my favourite singer 'Bono', I could meet him and I helped him to repair his guitar because it didn't sound very well. The rest of the days I wasn't doing anything especial, just I helped to organise the rehearsals of the differents group who were going to play in the concert. Best wishes, ",29.0
819," Dear Helen Ryan, First at all, I'd like to thanks  for the prize  Won. I'd like to know  USA. this prize came in a good time. I'd like to travell in july because I've got an examination at USP in Roo Cohelo in July. For it the only one that I can travel is July. And I'd like to stay in a log cabins because I can't bear sleeping in a tent, I hate this kind of accomodation. But I love sports. I'd like to play Tennis and  swimming these are my favourite sports. I can play tennis better  I can swim, because since I was I child I've been practising it. I've already Won three prizes about it. And I'd like to know about what kind of clothes to take and how much money to take too. I've never gone to  USA before. I hope I will have a good journey. Yours Sincerely, ALBiTO.  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable. We had a class discussion about shopping, for it I'm writing to tell about my opinion. I love shopping mainly when I am alone on when I am angry because I think it can help me to relax. When I  got plenty of money sometimes I like spend a bit of it with some friends or buying a good present for my girl friend. But if I haven't got enough money to spend or if I am sad shopping is not always enjoyable, because without money and  sad  is not a good idea to go to shopping. Normally I spend money buying some new clothes that I like more and shoes I love new shoes. One good idea  to go to shopping is when you  got plenty of money. ALBiTO ",28.0
1005," 13.06.2000 Dear Mrs. Ryan, thank you very much for your letter. I am happy that I won the first prize and I am looking forward to travelling to California. You have had some questions which I would like to answer now: - Time of travelling: According to the vacations and school holidays in Germany I am only able to travel in July. Due to this fact I hope you can arrange it for me. - Accomodation:  Log cabins would be nice for me to stay in when I am in California. You now that we are not used to living in such high temperatures in Germany as it will be then in California. I suppose I will have more fun if there is a cabin which is air conditioned. If there are only tents available at this time it will not be a problem for me , too. - Activities: During my stay I would like to do swimming and surfing. I know it will be hot there and California is famous for its beaches. I am a good swimmer and hope to improve my swimming style, too. On the other side I have no experience in surfing, - I am an absolute beginner with high motivation. - Additional question: Could you tell me how much extra money is usually needed for a two week camping ? I am looking forward to getting further information from you. Greetings from Germany! Yours sincerely Bruno Aachen  [SEP]  ""Shopping is not always enjoyable"". Before we can give our opinions on this statemant we have to make sure that everyone knows what we are discussing about. 'Shopping' stands for buying goods for your daily requirements, e.g. food, clothes. We do not speak here about luxuary goods. In this contest, shopping means a compulsory exercise you have to do regularly and frequently. It is not enjoyable if you look at it as a duty. But if you realize how important it is for your health what you buy you will go shopping with much more consiousness and  joy than before. 'Shopping' could be annoying if you look at it as a waste of time because you do it every day. Reorganize your behaviour of shopping and plan to keep food in stock! Try the internet and use e-business and online-shopping to order your pants for example. This is even an appropriate way to get around  unfriendly service you get to know if you have to buy something in a shop right before closing time. Choose your clothes at home after you have ordered them by e-mail! Another solution to get a friendlier service is of course to go to another shop. You have been presented  some causes why shopping is not always enjoyable. There are ways of behaviour to make more fun of it. It depends on every individual to change your mind and act as a 'smart' shopper. ",38.0
269," Dear Sir, I am writing to complain about the musical show 'OVER THE RAINBOW' I attended three days ago. I was very disappointed with the performance and apart from that there were many  problems. Firstly, the start time  was at 19.30 p.m, but the play started at 20.15 p.m. People were fed up with waiting so long and most of them apart from me were rather nervous. Secondly, the well-known star Danny Brook wasn't there, but a different actor  I had never heard from him. From my point of view I think he was such a very bad actor that  was impossible to fine another with the same features. As far as the tickets is concerned no discounts were available, so, moreover I found it expensive. After the show I went to visit the restaurant as it is said it is very famous and apart from that I wanted to have a drink. At the end I had to go home as it was closed because the coffee pot did not work. What nonsense! The evening was a disaster and I wonder if I have not the right to ask you for returning my money, as I think it is fair. I look forward to hearing from you, Yours faithfully, MARIA GARDENT  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. But this time things have gone too far. I've know Pat since we were kids. Little by little we were growing up and becaming close friends. I relyied on her and our relationship was excellent. I considered her my best friend and I thought we would never drift apart but now  my mind have changed, because she has done something I can't approve. She has given  away to my mother that I told her a lie as far as the weekend was concerned. Pat told her I hadn't spent those days with her, but with my boyfriend in the mountain. My mother was so hungry and she told off me so hard that I will remember it  the rest of my life. Moreover I was punished hardly by my father and now we don't talk  each other. Since then I haven't seen Pat anymore and she seems not regret that happened, so I'll try to forget her and carry on  my life that's all. ",26.0
909," Dear, Helen Thank you for the letter. I was very please when I knew that I had won the first prize. I would like to go there only in July, please. Because I have a holiday in July. For accommodation I would rather prefer log cabins because it's more comfortable than tents. And I don't have to worry about the weather. For two activities,  the first one can I have Tennis, please. Because I'm very good with tennis. I used to play a lot when I was a student. The second one can I have Photography, please. Because this's my hobby. And my dad just bought me a new camera. So this's will be my first chance that I can use it. Can you tell me what sort of clothes do I need to bring, please. I'm not sure about the weather in California in the daytime and in the nightime. And  any idea of how much money do I need to bring. Thank you very much for your offerring. I hope to hear back from you. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Hi, Kim Thanks for the letter asking about a pop concert. It was really good. I'm glad I went. My responsibilities are selling the tickets and making sure that everything is right. It was good to work with a lot of people and shared experiences. I met a lot of famous pop bands for the first time. I would feel sad if I didn't go there. They gave me a concert printed T-shirt. I'll show you by photographs. From that time I had a lot of friends also some of them are old friends from college. So we are still keep in touch. And  next concert we were promised we'll be there again. I wish you were there with us. Because sometimes you wouldn't have known the experience until you had done it. Any way I will sent you some photographs. I hope to hear back from you. Take care and don't work too hard. Please send my love to your family. Best wishes ",25.0
465," Dear Sir, My name is Yakimo Nashoto, I study in France and I went to London just to see ""Over the Rainbow"" because all my friends told me that it was ""great"". However, when I saw it, I was really disapointed and I  ask you  some money back. The reasons why I was disappointed were : First of all, Danny Brook was not there, I was very upset because he is my favorite singer and it was one of the reasons why I wanted to see this show. Then, the show started t 20.15 pm instead of 19.30. My Euro Star was at 22 pm. As you can see, I missed my train to go back to Paris. On the developpement, they also said that they will be a discount for students who are between eighteen and twenty-five years old but it was totally wrong because I paid the full price which was £20. Finally, I wanted to buy something to drink,  the restaurant was closed because it was on a bank holiday! As a conclusion, it was the worse evening I have ever had in my life so I  ask you for  money back. Your faithfully,  [SEP]  The modern technology has changed my daily life a lot. First of all,  Internet makes my life easier. Some of my friends live in overseas, we keep in touch by e-mails, it is a very good way for communicating because it is much cheaper than a phone call and we can re-read mails and keep them forever. Then, nine persons out of ten have a mobile phone in our society. I have one too! It is very useful for several reasons: when I want to call someone, I don't need to look after a phone box. people can phone me at anytime they want from everywhere when I go out, sometimes my parents are worried so they phone to me  if everything is going alright. Finally, there is a TV in my parent's car. We can watch TV, there is also a map so when we get lost, it is very east to find out the place. As a conclusion, I agree that modern technology has changed my daily life but I am sure that in the future, my life will not be the same as now because more modern technology will appear.  ",29.0
878," 13th June 2000 Dear Mrs. Ryan, I am writing with reference to your letter about the competition I won, in which you required some additional information. I am very happy to have won a two-week trip at Camp California, but for me it is only possible to travel in July because it is the only time when I can get holidays from work. Therefore, it is essential that you take account of my availability when booking the trip. As I am an expert camper, I would prefer to be accommodated in  tents  than in  log cabins. What concerns activities at the camp, I would be highly delighted if I could play basketball and tennis. The former because I am an excellent basketball-player and the latter because I am interested in taking up a new sport as I am a complete beginner at it. I am a little unsure about some things and I would be very grateful to you if you could answer my questions. I would like to know if I will need to take some special clothes and how much money would be suitable to bring with . I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  REPORT ON DAILY LIFE AT MY SCHOOL, FOR MY ENGLISH TEACHER Introduction After our English class' decision to make a short film about daily life in my school, I have been asked to write a report about interesting lessons and activities that should be filmed. The aim of this report is to inform my teacher about them. Here are my findings. Best lessons to film As all the students are different from each other, it is essential to show many aspects of the school. Therefore, to show the good aspects, I suggest to film Mr. Clark's English classes, because they are highly educative and because the students participate a lot. On the other hand, to show less pleasing aspects, it would be adequate to film Mrs. Morrison's French classes, as they are extremely boring and sub-standard. Interesting activities One event that should not be missed to film, is the weekly football game between teachers and students, which shows how well they get along with each other. Another event that should absolutely be captured on film is the preparation of the meals in the canteen. The cooks are very friendly and excellent. Conclusion In conclusion, I suggest that our English class seriously takes into consideration my suggestions when making the video. Because the above mentioned events are the most praised or criticised ones by all students. INDIAN DEMURO ",38.0
671," Dear Ms Helen Ryan, Thanks a lot for your briefly and nice letter. I am very pleased to give you the information required: Firstly, the most suitable month would be in July because I am very busy in my work now, and my children are in holiday then. Secondly, I prefer to stay in log cabins, because they are more comfortable. I confess you that I have never been in a tent and till now I have never had the intention  to do it. The activities are really interesting and I would take part on Painting and Climbing. I am not very good  painting, but I like it because  is a good oportunity to practice it. Personally, Climbing is an interesting activity, where you need concentration and you are working with your whole body. I don't want to dissapoint you, but I am beginner! I choose these activities because I love challenges. I would appreciate  if you can tell me a couple of ideas about  clothes I  need there. Thanks in advance. Sincerely, G. Ramos  [SEP]  Wuthering Heights - Emily Brontë Not only bad characters in a story are more interesting than the good ones, but also this take your attention. In this book, Heathcliff as a child hadn't a bad character but the situations  lived  with the family Earnshaw, where the grown up, made him rude, agresive and noisy. Heathcliff used to play with Catherine. They were good friends but Heanly, brother of Catherine, hatted Heathcliff. Heanley couldn't accept the good relationship and love between Catherine and Heathcliff and, for that reason he sent Heathcliff to work in the farm. In the mean time Catherine knew Edgar Linton and at the end she married Edgar because of  money and good education. Heathcliff promised  himself and worked his whole life  taking a revenge. Before Heathcliff died he riched what he wanted. The houses and money of the families Earnshaw and Linton, all belonged to him. and he was buried near to Catherine!, his great and only love! ",29.0
745," Dear Sir/Madam. I've just recived your leter, and I must say that I am so surprised, I wasn't expecting to win it. I  still studing at the moment I will finish at the end of June so I will be able to leave at the begining of July. About the acomodation, I would prefer a log cabin instead of a tent so as to get a better rest. I've got some problem to sleep and a log cabin will be more peaceful than a ten. You are asking me to choose just 2 activities. It's quite dificult for me because there are 4 of them I like a lot wich are climbing, tennis, surfing and photography, but if I have to make a choise, I choose climbing and surfing. I'm rather trained in climbing, I have done it once a mounth since I was 17. But in the other hand, I have never done surfing, I am a completely Beginer but I am dieing to do it. I've got just one question to do, I know it is all include, but is there anything I will have to pay for? If there is, please let me know. I am looking forward to hearing from you very soon, and please let me know if you need any further information. Yours Faithfully:  [SEP]  First of all, I think we should have a protagonist for it. A good idea to start will be a clock alarm ringing close to his bed, because that's the way everyone get up in the morning, (unless the people who don't do anythink) After that, we should have a morning view of one of the most busiest London tube station in order to show stressed people going in and out, Including our protagonist going out peacefully with a couple of books on his hand - then the school's door, and him going in. After all this introduction,  will be the time to show some of the acitivities every one can join in the school, such as lesons or others like the library, our protagonist having a cofe with some coleagues in the cofe bar, the reception service.. And finally a view of all the students leaving the school would be a nice end. ",16.0
1189,"  Dear Maria, First of all, I am sorry to hear that Richard is ill. As the conference must go on, I will give you the information you asked for in order to work on with this conference. According to the hotel, the group has been arranged to stay in a hotel which is very near the place  we are going to have the conference. The hotel is The Palace Hotel. It'is just only 5 minutes walk from there to the conference and I would like to suggest that this is the best way to get to the conference. About the party, we will have a party at the end of the conference at the hotel  you will stay. The party will be in a friendly atmosphere so don't worry about what to wear. There will be only our group, so dress whatever you want and enjoy ourselves. Lastly, what you could possibly do while you will be waiting for three hours, for some people who want to go shopping. The shopping centre is just right opposite of the hotel, however, some people may want to just wait at the hotel, having a cup of coffee. The cafe in the hotel is available. I hope that  information will be useful. If you have any questions I am more than happy to help. I look forward to seeing you at the conference. Yours sincerely.  [SEP]  Could you live without this? Imagine how your life would be if you woke up one morning and found that all the electricity had gone. How would you manage to get yourself ready to go to work. How would you know what happens in the whole wide world or even how you would get yourself breakfast without  toaster!!! How would you cope with all those? Thank god for those who had created the electricity and had appliedapplied it into every appliances. The electricity is a clever invention. Everything bases on the use of electricity, for instance from a little bulb light to the most complicated computer system which stored priceless information! Life wouldn't be easy if we didn't have electricity. The electricity is very important in keeping our lives go. No matter where you are, what you do, apparantly, you need the electricity. Let's think  this way, if we didn't have the electricity, there would be no other inventions at all!! I, personally, couldn't live without the electricity. It has already affected and play a great role in my life. I watch the television and use the computer everyday. Moreover, other facilities in my house,  telephone, air-conditioner, fridge, for example, they are all need the electricity. That'is why it is very important to my life. ",37.00
485," Dear Sir/Madam. My name is Veronika. And I visited your theatre to see a musical show ""Over the Rainbow"". I am writing to you to say that it was a very disappointing evening. And I'll try to explain why. First of all, there were the different actors in a show, but you didn't say anything about it before the show. The other point was the beginning of the show. It started at 20:15, but it was said that it starts at 19:30. As a result I missed my train. The third problem was the discounts. There were no ay discount at all. But I am a student and I know that I can get tickets with the discount. And the last disappointment was your restaurant after the show. It was closed because of the lack of stuth Of course I want to get my money back, but I know that I will never get it. So as a conclusion I want to give you one piece of advice - try to organise your shows more carefully. With the best wishes  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed your daily life? We know that everything is changing. And of course the technology is also changing. Not so long ago we had to do many things by our hand, but now there re a lot of machines to do the same. And it makes our life easier. Now we have free time to do anything else, while  machine is doing our work. It's connected with our house, our workplace and e.t.c. For example, earlier I used to wash my clothes by hand, but now I have the last version of wash machine and now there are no any reasons to do it by hand. Earlier it took me 3 hours, but now it is my free time and I can go for a walk with my friends. Another example is that earlier we had to rewrite some documents by hand just to make a copy. Now we have a scanner and a printer to do it. And it takes bout 1 minute to make a copy but not 1 hour. So, I think that modern technology gives us a lot of opportunities to do the   really important for our life things. ",28.0
935," Dear Mrs Helen Ryan, I received your letter last week and was surprised to see that I won a competition. It is the first time it happens to me. Unfortunately I'm free only in July. Actually I will be busy working abroad until the end of June and will be on holidays with my family in August. You asked me which accomodation I would prefer. It's ages since I have been sleeping in a tent and I would be happy to experiment it again. It will remind me  some wonderful experiences. According to the activities, I would like to do some painting, which I am quite good at. The second activity I chose is sailing. I went two times on a sailing ship without doing anything, therefore have I got no experience at all. May I ask you how much money do I need and which sort of clothes do you advise me to take? I look forward to your answer and to the camp, naturally. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Kim, Thank you very much for your last letter. As you asked me in your letter, I will try to explain my wonderful experience at this pop concert. First of all you have to know that it wasn't a common pop concert, but a real open air festival. It isn't the first year that I work there. However this year wasn't like last year. My job was as simple as selling ice-creams. You might say that it is quite boring, but it was so funny. Everybody was so relaxed; we were singing and dancing while selling ice-creams in our little van. Byran Adams himself bought me an ice-cream. It was  amazing experience. What I particularly liked about it was that the staff was like a big family. Everybody was ready to help each other. I was really impressed by this solidarity and friendship which is quite rare in Switzerland. I look forward to hearing from you and wish you all the best. Love from ",31.0
408," lausanne, the 17th of June 2000 Dear Sir, Last weekend, I have been in London with my friend and I saw your musical show ""over the Rainbow"". I write this letter to you for explain my very bad evening I have passed in  theatre. On the paper it was writting  the principal actor is ""Danny Brook"" but it wasn't him, it was a different actor that we have never seen, and heard. I think it's really not correct. They haven't respect the timetable, the show had to begun at 19:30 and he started at 20:15 how can you explain this fault?! But it's not finish you wrote on the paper ""Discounts available"" but it wasn't true, it was a very badly organisation. After this bad show we had want to go to the Restaurant for  drunk and ate something and it was closed and nobody had explained  us why the Restaurant wasn't open. So, I'm very angry when I think about this evening, and I want to have my money back. I think it's the minimum you have to do for me. Thank you in advance.  [SEP]  SCHOOLS ENGLISH LANGUAGE MAGAZINE Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, this sentance is very popular in our school. Pat is not an angry girl.

I asked my parents and they said alright you can go to Pat for sleeping. I was very happy, I phone to my boyfriend and I explained him my secret he said allright so at nine o'clock in front of the cinema"".

272," London, 1st of June 2000 Mister Jones, I'm Omadar, a spanish male of eighteen years old who is spending in this town a week holiday. I decided to enjoy a play at the theatre  wich you're the manager to see the ""London's newest and best musical show."" My opinion? I had a very disappointing evening. First, Danny Brook doesn't play  ""Over the rainbow"" his paper was played by Danny De Vito. Also, the play started fourty five minutes late than the starting hour. I can understand that a play can start fifteen minutes late, but not fourty five. Second, my wife and me payed £20 for the tickets and we asked for discounts. The receptionist who gave me the tickets told me that no discounts were able that night. After a boring play, I decided to go  an theatre restaurant, but uncertainly it was closed. I decided to go home and prepare some sandwiches. The principal reason for I'm writting  you at the moment is that I want my money back, because I felt so disappointing with the theatre and also with the play. Your sincerelly,  [SEP]  It's a good question, because I never had asked it to myself. I think modern technology is changing so much my daily life and also is changing the life of others like me. Before modern technologies arrived, you can't comunicate as easy as today we can do. An example could be the Internet. It changed my life, because with it I can discover more information than  a newspaper, and also information of all around the world, that possibly never I can access without  Internet. But,  is not only news or information. You can comunicate with people from place were you  never can imagine to have a trip because it will be too expensive. An extract could be the popular chats, where people write with the keyboard what they want to tell. But, if you don't like to use the keyboard to tell something or comunicate, you can use video conference, a sistem wich  you can talk with other people simply with a microphone and speakers. Also  is the possibility of download things to your pc like software, pictures and also, music. The modern technologies make me  able to listen the music I've downloaded with the same quality as a CD, and if I buy a reproductor, I can wear this music to everywere. Also computers and mobile phones had evolutioned thanks to modern technologies. Without this evolution, we  probably still get on the ancient times. Who wants to return to the ancient times? No electricity, no canalized water, no healthy water, no TV's, no phones, no PC's.. I'm afraid that the people on the ancient times lived although they don't have anything of these things, but me and everyone of this times, I'm afraid that we wouldn't like return to this life. As well, I think that modern technologies are necessary, but also I think that  are so expensive, but with time, the price goes down. So, if the price goes down   is because anything new is at the moment for sell. Is like a round tour. ",22.0
336," Dear sir, I am writing to draw your attention to the musical show that was place last evening. None of  conditions was fulfilled: firstly, Danny Brook, who was going to perform in the show, was changed by another actor. As a result it was a disappointing performance. Furthermore, the show started at 20:15 while the advertisment said that it was going to begin at 19:30. On the other hand, it there wasn't any discounts in the sell of the tickets. To make matters worse, when the show finished we couldn't visit the theatre restaurant because of the fact that it was closed (since it was being painted). I am very surprised that such a reputable theatre like yours has been able to break all  promises that appeared in the advertisment. Of course, what it was going to be a perfect evening out turned into a very disappointing evening, and I would  very greatful if you  refund me a compensation. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  What will clothes be like 100 years from now? I imagine it will be very different. Sciencist will invented new materials that will keep the  temperature in a suitable range. In that way people won't feel cold or hot, they will be always at the same temperature. In addition these new material won't weight hardly anything. As well, people won't be as worried about fashion as nowaday, however it will be very important that clothes are comfortable and suitable for your work and daily duties as well as sport or everything you have to do. For that reason clothes will be simplier and more practise. Besides, everybody will be able to afford to buy  then that's why the prize of this sort of material will be very available. Of course, the resources used and  manufacturing  will be completely harmless for the enviroment because people will be more aware of the neccesity of taking care of the world we live in. ",31.0

I think it would be better for me to travel on July. I will started an Italian course in August, so it will be impossible for me to leave . In your letter you ask me to choose beetween tents or log cabins, well I prefer to stay in a log cabin. It is more confortable and I am afraid about wild animals. I saw, you offer a lot of activities, that'is fantastic! It is very difficult to decide which two of these activities I like  and I can also do the best. I think I choose singing because I have sung for five years in a church chorus and I do it very well. The other activity I like very muche is swimming. I took part at a lot of competitions. Now I would like to ask you if wee need some money and if it is necessary to take with me special clothes. I hope I have give to you all the information you needed and I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely B. Müller  [SEP]  Geneva, 13th June 2000 Dear Kim I am happy to tell you about the experience I made at the pop concert last month. I had to start very early in the morning, at 7.30. We first had to prapare the stands with food and drinks and buy something which had been forgotten. Then we had to put on the night lights and decorate the whole room. In the afternoon the singers cames in and I also could have an interview with Ricky Martin. I was very excited! He is very beatiful! At the end of the interview he invites me to have dinner with him after the concert. I logically accepted. The interview I liked particularly Before the concert started, we had to  verify all  music instruments. The microphones all had to be controlled. Fortunatly we had no problem. The concert was a success. I was very proude of me and the work I had done. After  concert I left with Ricky Martin. We went to a nice restaurant and enjoyed dinner together. I am sure my dear Kim, I will never forget that wonderful experience.

268," Saturday, June, 17th Dear M. White, I went to the Circle theatre last week on monday and I would say that I had a very disappointing evening, there. Firstly, I've read in the advertisement that the actors who were playing that night were D. Brook and T. Truelove. Now you can guess how disappointed I was when I saw that there were different (and worse) actors! Secondly, the musical show started at 20.15 instead of 19.30.. so I had to wait forty-five minutes outside and it was raining cats and dogs! And then I discovered that the discounts were not available for the tickets. Moreover, the theatre restaurant was closed after the show and I was really hungry because I hadn't had my dinner that evening in order to be on time for the show. To sum up, It wasn't a ""perfect evening out"". I'd rather say that it was a catastrophe! And I am really sorry, but consequently I would ask you for some money back. Thank you for considering my request. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Modern technology has completly changed my daily life, which became more comfortable, and easier. For instance, my discman gives me the possibility to listen to music or to the radio everywhere: in the underground, or when I walk in the city. Moreover, it disturbs nobody, and that's great. Another simple example is my mobile telephone; A few years ago, I had to buy a telephone card and then to find a telephone box to call my parents and to tell them that I would be late for dinner, or other stuff like that. Yet my hand phone is in my bag and I bring it everywhere. But I think the best technological invention which changed my life is the internet - Thanks to it, I have  hundred friends all over the world and I know many different cultures. All these examples are very few demonstrations to show how technology could affect our lives nowadays. In my point of view, modern technology is a great thing unless it is used to serve bad intentions. ",32.0

1101," Dear Mr Robertson Thank you for organising the trip to London. It is very fantastic especially the programme on 13th March that we are having a river trip to Greenwich. The purpose that I am writing due to the fact that my class has seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show. It is worth visiting  exhibition and we would like to go there. The show is established on Tuesday March 14th at  Central Exhibition Hall London from 10.00 to 19.00. In the hall, there are four important themes; latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up, and hairstyles. This is  great opportunity for the student to learn  the changing in fashion and leisure and it is free. I was wondering if you would consider our suggestion about changing the programme. We agreed all that the programme on Monday March 13th is wonderful. However, we would like to change the plans on Tuesday and Wednesday in the morning. On Tuesday morning, we will visit the London Fashion and Leisure show instead of visiting  Science Museum and we will go there tomorrow morning. Visiting   National Art Gallery should be cancelled because it has a similar idea comparing to the programme that we would like to go on Tuesday morning. That  all I would like to recommend you . It would be greatful if you could consider our suggestion and please inform us about your decision as soon as possible. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  The discussion about whether or not the famous people deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time is the controversial one. There are people from both side of  agrument who have strong feelings. There is evidence that these people's life should be advertised by the media. Obviously, they have a lot of fans and their fans would like to know what happened to them. In addition, their life may be the good example for other people to follow. Sometime, many people don't know what to do and they should the person who they admire to immitate. However, there is other disadvantages that we should consider. Firstly, the famous people would like to do anything they want  without being concentrated by  media. I think it  is annoying if you did something and tomorrow your performance would be known by the public. Eventhough, the famous people can be the good example, they should be the bad habit for public. A lot of people try to be like people who they admire, For example, buying the clothes that famous people wear. The reason that they know what kind of clothes that famous people wear is these people have a public life. To Prevent many people from copying too much we shouldn't inform  all aspects of  life of famous people. I agree that the famous people life should be in private. It is the benefit for themselves and the public. ",21.00
380," Dear Sir/Madam I went to see 'over the rainbow' presented by the circle theater. I was really disappointed therefore I am writing a  complain. Firstly I bought the ticket because I like Danny Brook's acting but in the show someone was acting his part. Also the person was not really good at acting. Secondly the time on the leaflet is totaly wrong. It said it will start at 19:30. Infact it started t 20:15. I was waiting for 45 minuts. Thirdly the ticket was no discount and after the show I visited  theater restaurant but it was close because the show started too late. Finaly last nigh was not  perfect evening. (Therefore) I want to have  money back and I hope you will think about these problems. Your faithfully  [SEP]  I am writing an article about  fashion of the future to the international student magazine. Fashion are always changing therefore it is really difficult to say what sort of clothes people wear in  future. But when I heard the word of future, I have  image of metalic colour so that  my imagination they are wearing metalic or bright colour cloth. May be they have more different types of colour than now. However I think the style of fashion will not have big differences because I believe that fashion is in a circle. The mean of this is all our fashion styles come from history. For example our fashion style at the moment is comes from 70's fashion. We always repeat the fashion with adding some new fashion at that time.  I think the people will wear clothes which are metalic or bright colourful colour with mixture of history and future fashion style. in  future. ",25.0
956,"  Mrs Ryan When I received your letter, I was very surprised and happy because I don't remember that I did this competition. First I can travel only in July because, I will finish school at the end of June and I will pass my exam in Septemeber; so I have to repeat  it a lot during the month of August. To answer your second question, I choose the accomodation in  tents because I like to sleep outside. For the activities, I choose the Golf and the Surfing (that wasn't easy to decide which activities I will do, cause almost  choice interested me) I tried the golf twice, I'm really bad but I hope to do much progress . I never did surfing, but every time I see surfing on television I find this magic. I have just two questions. Can I wash any clothes there? How many money will I have to take with me? Please phone me to answer my two questions. Thanks for all Mar  [SEP]  Hello Kim I'm sorry I can only write now because last week I have too much work. As you asked me I will tell you about the pop concert of last month. With my friend Miko we looked for a little job during a week-end and one evening we met a guy who wanted to buy some drinks in the pop concert and so we told him that we were agree to help him at the bar. It was a wonderful week-end: we were opposite to the singers and we have seen every concert without buying any tickets entry! (we were include in the staff of the concert) At the end we have 1200. - of benefice and each  us take 400. - for himself I particulary like seeing all this people, and I meet a lot of new friend there. For next year we search for a new barwoman. Write to me soon and tell me if you want to join us for 2001. Love Mar ",22.0
574," Dear Ms. Ryan, It was  wonderful surprise when I received your letter. Thank you very much for this great opportunity. Now, I am writing this letter to reply  your questions. Firstly, I would like to inform you that I will be able to travel only in July, which is the only month I can take holiday from my work. Secondly, for accomodation, I prefer to say in log cabins, as I have no experience staying in a tent, I hesitate to try. Regarding to the activities, I would rather choose singing and painting, as unfortunately, I am not good at sports. However, I enjoy singing. I used to join the singing club when I was a high school student and once we won the contest, moreover, painting is one of my favorite hobbies. I normally bring blushes, paints and paper instead of  camera when I travel. Finally, I would like to ask you wheather  anything I should bring to this travel such as specific clothes, extra money etc. I look forward to receiving your reply. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Kim, Thanks for your letter. Yes! It was a privelage to help at a pop concert. I really wished you were there with me. Believe it or not, it was a concert of ""the Rolling Stones""! I did various things for them. At first, I helped stage setting, as you know they use lots of unique tricks in their concert. So it was very interesting to know how they are made.  Then, I helped tuning the instruments for the back band. Actually, as I know nothing about instruments, the only thing I could do was just turning the volume up and down following to the musician's instruction. My dear friend, if I tell you this, I am sure you will get jelous. This was the best experience. I could give the members ""Shiatsu massage"" just before the concert to make them relax!! Can you imagine how much I appreciated that I am qualified in massage? Well, Kim, I have to go now. Hope to hear from you soon. Love, ",31.0
243," Sir, I'm writing to you because I want you to give the money back for your  ""London's newest and best musical show: Over the rainbow"", presented in the Circle Theatre. In fact, unlike the perfect evening out that you promised on your advertisement, I had a very disapointing evening. Firstly, I expected to see Danny Brook in the show, but he was replaced by another actor. Why was he not here? Moreover I had to wait forty five minutes to see the beginning of the show. And I hate to wait! There was also the discounts wich weren't available. And to finish, the restaurant was closed, for any reasons you didn't take to us. So I couldn't eat this evening. Hoping you'll satisfy my request.  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. So the surprise we prepared for the Leon's birthday had failed. However, we've started to search an idea for it for one months . In the beginning, I wanted to bring him in my house where everybody would wait for him. But he wanted to stay at his home. So Sigone found the greatest idea. We would pretend to have bought for him a dog. Leon hate dog, and I don't know why. So we had to find a dog that Leon wouldn't recognized. And I found one. I had a friend who had just received a little dog. But he was a Pat's friend too, and Pat explained everything to Leon. No luck. ",28.0
873," Dear miss Ryan, With reference to your letter of  13th of June I would like to thank you for the prize your organisation is offering me. I am pleased to provide you with the following information. Since I am a student I have to follow the vacation programm of my school, which means that I would only be able to travel during the month of July. I would be grateful if you could book a tent for me at Camp California because I am a nature lover and the idea of outdoor-sleeping really makes me happy. Concerning the activities, as a matter of fact tennis is my favorit sport and I am very keen on it, for the second activity I would like to enroll  surfing, because my husband, who is already a proficient , keeps telling me about the excitement of this sport, and I think it is worthwile trying, therefore I'd love to be in the beginners group. I would like to know if you would be kind enough to send me some information on weather conditions for that period of time, the kind of currency I should take with  as well as the vaccination requirements. I am looking forward to hearing from you and thank you in advance for your help. Yours faithfully Abril Botella  [SEP]  Benoni's school is a recognised school for tourism located in the heart of Brussels, Belgium. It offers a wide choice of courses from cooking, computer, make up, languages, geographie to culture and civilization. Students start their day at the Gym, where they learn the importance of being fit, that is way I suggest to film this activity. Once students have taken a shower after a hard physical training they come to real life, depending on their levels  they have to study for instance languages wich I personally find very important for a person working in the tourism field because these enables stuff to communicate with clients in a proper way, students have to manage to speak at least three languages. Another important lesson to film is ""culture and civilization, therefore people will know that the hostessess prepered at this school are not only, as  French say, ""pot-au-fleurs"", beautiful faces to show off but also well read persons. Last but not less important is the class called ""know-how"" wich shows students how to cope with unspected problems even if they are in stress. I would also take an outdoor lesson ""training"". The school works together with known companies of the branch  as Mariot hotel, Air France Princess cruise among others in order to provide students with high qualified training. ",35.0

You have informed the actor, times, discount and the restaurant to people, but actually what did you do? The first, you have changed the actor. The second, the time is late from 19.30, it started 20.15. The third, the tickets have not the discount. The last, after  show, I couldn't go to the restaurant, because it was closed. What's happened? This is the good theatre do, or not? This is the famous theatre. You know, What did people feel? Everybody attented go to the show, funny, and happ in the end, and what have we go then? Disapponted! Thank about that. If you can not managed the programe, why did you informe people before  programe start? I tought you inderstood'; please send money back to me, you know why, don't answer me?

507," 17/06/2000 Mr Smith, I write  you because last friday I had a very disappointing evening in your theatre. I went there because I had read a banner about the musical show ""Over the rainbow"", but many informations were wrong. Last week I was in London with my friends and we decided to go to the theatre to see how the famous Danny Brook act. But when we arrived at 2.00 pm to see the show of 2.30 p.m., we couldn't enter in the theatre because the discounts weren't available. So we returned in the evening and we waited 45 minutes until the beginning of the show! No only : we had the bad surprise that Brook had been substituded by another actor! I ask you if is it possible to have my money back, please, because I want to forgot that expense. Thank you. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Modern technology can't not transforme our daily life. The inventions of the airplane, of the train and of the car, have reduced the distances of the world, so we can go to the other side of the world in half a day. It means that daily life is faster and busier because I'm able to go to school in the morning and then to play soccer in the afternoon, and after  few minutes I can stay in the other side of Lecce to play piano with my musical band, then I can go back home when I want, listening  the notices about what happens around the world with the radio of my car. So I have must more interestings things to do in my life. But the most important innovation of technology development is the computer. In everytime of the day I can communicate with people of all nationality of the world, I can have informations about everything, I can buy something which I can't find in the shops of my town, so I can do anything just  clicking on the mouse! Sadly, there is also a negative aspect. Sometimes,  computer substitudes real relationships between people. In fact, many boys pass several hours in front of their computer and the forgive that out of their houses there are their friends.... In conclusion, I think that modern technology get my life more interesting, but I prefer to stay with my friends and with my girlfriend then in front of a computer! ",22.0
1137," Dear Mr. Robertson. I am writing on our class behalf to thank you for organising our tour in London. Our class is very appritiate you for the good programme. Especially, we are interested in the sightseeing by bus on Monday morning and the river trip to Greenwich at the afternoon. It is a good idea to include the visiting of the Science Museum and the National Art Gallery at  morning time on Tuesday and Wednesday respectivelly. However, the students in our class have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show at the Central Exhibition Hall of London on Tuesday from 10 am to 7 p.m. All of us would like to go to the show. It is a great opportunity because of the following reasons. Firstly, there will be leisur and sports wear and the latest fasions. Secondly, there will be exibitions about makeup and hair styles. Moreover, the entrance for students is free. We suggest changing our programme a little bit. Instead of Wednesday's afternoon free time we could visit the Science Museum. And on Tuesday we will enjoy the London fasion and Leisure Show till 19.00. After all we will be able go shopping. I am looking forward to recieving your positive reply. For the further details you can contact me my phone number. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Famous people. What does it means? From my point of view, these are the people, who stay all  time in our sigh. We  intrsted in politicians's and film stars's wear, hobbys, passions and the intrigues. The lardge numbers of the journalists following them all the time, even in there private life. In my opinion, each human being has  rights to be free. We can go for a wolk, go shopping go to the cinema,  marrige or devorce. Why famous people couldn't do all this things? Why everybody must know and tolk about their private life? The most important thing  that the famous people are also normal people as us. They live as us, they brief and eat as us, they even following in love as us. I think, they must have a normal, private life without journalists following them all the time and without any exact details about them  in the different newspaper's curiouses. ",21.00
1096," Dear Mr. Robertson First of all I would like to thank you for organizing this trip to London, and for taking care of the programme. It is a very good shedule, especially because you have considered different activities for us. However, we saw an advertisement, and we are keen on the idea of going to the London Fashion and Leisure Show. It will take place on Tuesday March 14th at the Central Exhibition Hall, from 10.00 to 19.00. Personally, I think it can be a great opportunity because it is something we all want to attent to, and we are all fond of the latest fashion. We noticed that it is free for students so the price of the trip will not rise. We discussed about the programme, and because the show will take the whole day, we would not mind going to the Science Museum on Wenesday instead of having free time all afternoon. I am looking forward to having your answer. Yours sincerelly  [SEP]  It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. It was a new challenge, and not only for me, but for everyone there. Nobody thought I was capable of doing it. I wasn't sure of what to do, and the pressure of everyone watching me, was driving me mad. Finally, I managed to move my right foot closer to the edge. I could listen the crowd shouting 'Go, Go'. That was my only chance.. Only  few more seconds, otherwise my time would be over. I didn't even think of boking down. I was already paralysed, and that wouldn't help me at all. Then, by some 'strange power' my left foot was moving and I wanted to stop it, but it was too difficult. The clock was running.. tic, tac... And suddenly everything stopped. I felt an enourmous peace. Somehow I managed to jump out of the airplane and I was flying! Those minutes, up in the air, feeling the wind in my face, were fantastic....And then I was terrified when I couldn't open the parachute! Fortunatelly, I wasn't alone. ",35.00
186," Dear Sir/Madam, I went to the Circle Theatre to see the musical show ""Over The Rainbow."" Unfortunately, I had a very disappointing evening, because very little of what was offered in the advertisements was provided. Firstly, we were informed that Danny Brook was starring but a different actor was starring in the show and he was really disappointing. Secondly, in the advertisement it was written that the show was to start at 19:30. However, it started at 20:15, almost an hour late. Thirdly, it was written that discounts were available but we were again frustrated, seing they were not available. Finally, although we were informed that the theatre restaurant would be open after the show, it was closed because the show had started late. As you can see, most of the offered activities in the advertisements were not provided. We did not have ""a perfect evening"" as it was written, actually we had an evening full of the theatre's mistakes and were extremely disappointed. I suppose it will be better for your theatre's reputation to give at least some of my money back. Yours Sincerely,  [SEP]  MY LIFE AND MODERN TECHNOLOGY Here we are, in the 21st century... We live in a technologically well-developed world, having every opportunity for communication, education and entertainment. Almost everyone has televisions, computers and electronic devices. But how has modern technology changed our lives? If I were to talk about my own life, my speech would be simple: ""My electronic alarm-clock wakes me up in the morning. I go to school by underground. When I come home, I cook my meal in the microwave. In my spare time, I watch television, play with my computer, or chat in the internet..."" There is no sentence without electronic devices. I wonder what I could do without them... I don't go out with my friends or read books. I have friends in the internet and can learn anything while surfing in it. I sometimes get bored or feel isolated, because I know I am living in a virtual world. When I look at my life, I can understand I am dependent on the machines. My daily life is programmed up to the virtual world I created. Modern technology has changed my life completely. ",37.0
237," Dear manager, I recently had a week's holiday in London. During my stay I went to your theatre to see a musical show which was OVER THE RAINBOW, however, I had a very disappointing evening. There are a lot of differences between the details of the musical show on the advertisement and the ones it actually was. Firstly the starring on the advertisement were Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, while there were different actors on the musical show. Secondly time starts at 19:30 on the leafet but it actually started at 20:15. Thirdly it said there were discounts available on the advertisement, however, there was not any at all. Finally it said we could visit your theatre restaurant after the show but it was colsed because your excuse of being used at that moment. It said on the leafet that your perfect evening out, while it was not  at all. I felt very disappointing after seeing the music show in your theatre. As I said the reasons above, I want to ask for  money back! I look forwards to hearing from you. Yours faithfully,   [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. He was so kind that the couldn't stop telling Janet that she was going to be killed by Mr Brown After finishing that Pat left this room. Janet was so nervous that she couldn't stop her heart throbbing quickly. She went quietly downstair and closed the door as soon as she went into her room. At that moment a lot of things appeared in her mind which seemed as  just happened yesterday. ""Why did Mr Brown want to kill me?"" She said to herself ""I am just a servant in this castle, I loves him so much and I don't want anything from him although he is the owner of this castle."" while it seemed as  a shadow came in from the window and disappeared quickly. Everything in the room is quiet except the sound of the clock as if everything is going to die. She was so frighten and sad that she had no energry. She fell down onto the floor and wept, while nobody could help her. ",20.0
807," Dear Helen, I received your letter the other day,  I was very happy to find out that I won two weeks at Camp California. Well, to answer to your questions, I would prefer to attend at this camp during the month of July because it is the only time when I can get vacations. It is because I am an apprentice, so they let me have my vacations only in July!! Well, for the accomodation at Camp California I would prefer staying in a tent. I think it is more fun sleeping in a tent than in a log cabin. It is more like  adventure being in a tent, and you are closer to the nature, and the animals! For the activities I think I will choose swimming because I love swimming and being in the water. And I am really good at it, I used to do some competitions when I was younger. And for the other  I will chose tennis, I really enjoy this sport, I am not really a good player but I like to practice tennis during my free time! Since I'm coming during the month of July what kind of clothes should I take with me, and I have another question, it's about money. How much should I take? And is it better to have change or checks? Best Regards, Helen  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable Well this is abosolutly true, espacially when you go shopping on Saturday. Everyone goes shopping on Saturday so the mall is always crowed, and most of the people are stressed, it's crazy. For exemple you go into a cloth shop, you see all those women running around trying to find the shirt that would fit their new skirt, so they are looking every where, pushing you because they think that you will take the shirt that they want. And then they have  and you have to wait to try on the pants or the skirt you choose. And you have to wait after  to buy it, so finally you waited so long that you are getting late, so you get stressed to. So it's really not enjoyable to go shopping. Plus most of the time, you see all those mothers looking after their kids, and yelling their name's kids into the shopping mall because they lost them. So you are getting a headache because you hear the kids crying, the mothers yelling, if I can give you an advice: DON'T GO SHOPPING ON SATURDAY!! You get headaches, you get stressed, and finally you get bruses because of the woman that pushed you to get the pretty skirt before you!!! ",34.0

This show takes place at  Central Exhibition Hall in London on Tuesday 14th March from 10:00 to 19:00 o'clock. All my classmates are very interested in this show, which includes  latest fashions, Leisure and sports wear, Make up, and Hair styles. Moreover, one of the important thing for us is that entrance fee is free for students, because students are generally short of money. We would like to suggest you change  shopping date to Wednesday afternoon, because we have  free time on Wednesday afternoon. We would be very pleased if you could consider our recommendation. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Private Life For Everyone. Everyone deserve  private life. However most famous people, for example football player and film stars, have not got any privet life. They feel exhausted to be followed by journalists  Even they have an argue with journalists as they sometimes write unreal news. On the other hand, some people need journalists to be more famous, because people can have news who are famous through journalists. As a result, journalists should respect their life and always write real news. ",19.00
509," Dear Mr. Smith: I am writting in order to complain about the musical show ""Over the rainbow"". At first, the advertisement said that the show was starring by Tina Truelove and Danny Brook, that was not true, Danny Brook did not act in the show, it was a different actor and I got disappointed with him. In order to the times , the show was supposed to start at 19.30 and it started at 20.15, nobody likes to wait 45 minutes just watching empty scenary. Another thing, the tickets. The advertisement said that there were discounts available, that was false, there were not any kind of discounts. After all  I just wanted to go to the restaurant of the theatre and have something to eat, but it was closed because the police had closed it. They had closed it because they had found the food in  bad conditions. Just to finish, the advertisement said that the show would be a perfect evening out, let me tell  that it wasn't not. I paid  a full ticket without discounts to wait 45 minutes, to see a musical show with a bad actor and after all  could not have a sandwich because the restaurant was closed. I think the theatre should give me my money back and I hope you do it. Yours faithfully.  [SEP]  Technology. The technology has changed, is changing and it will change our daily lifes. Technology is improving every day, soon everything will be done by a machine. Now we can cook in a easier way than ten years before, we can talk with somebody who is 10000 kilometres from us and we can know what's happening in the other part of the world.

Now we can buy everything by  Internet, we can see what's happening in Wall Street, we can send mail in a easier way, by e-mail and many people has started to work at home by their computers. Technology has changed so much our daily lifes that we won't be able to live without it. Nobody can imagine to live without a T.V., a computer, a microwave, a telephone. There are machines for everything, to write, to cook, to go from one place to other, to talk with somebody who is not with you. Our lifes are very different from our grandparent's lifes and that's because  the technology. ",31.0
351," Dear Sir/Madam, Last night I went to the Circle Theatre to see the show ""Over the Rainbow"", and I have to say that I had a very disappointing evening, even though I heard that the show was exciting. Two days before I read the advertisment for this show, where  Danny Brook was starring. Unfortunately last evening there was a different actor and that was very disappointing. Apart from that the show started at 20:15 not at 19:30, as it is written in the advertisment and the theatre restaurant was closed when the show finished. I am in London for a week and I had to say that last evening I had an awful time, so I want some of my money back. I am looking forward to receive your reply with my money. Yours faithfully,   [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Pat and I had been friends for a long time and as my best friend he knew all my secrets. Yesterday afternoon, when I went home, my mother want to talk  me for something, so I went in her bedroom to speak with her. She told me that she knew that last Saturday I went in a party without asked her and that she had to punish me for that. She told me that I had to stay at home for that weekend and not to go out with my friends. When I went in my bedroom I reliased that Pat had told my mother for the party, because noone else knew that my mother did not know that  I called him and we had a big argument. Pat is not a reliable person so he is not my best friend anymore. ",25.0
1002," Dr Mrs Ryan, With replay on your letter, I would like to say that I was really pleased with the first prize. It was the real surprise for me. I would like to travel just in July, because I am going to study at my university untill the end of June. I hope it will not be any problem for you. I am glad that all accommodation and travel costs have been paid. I would prefer to live in the tent cabin, I think it is more comfortable. I see people who run the camp are very good in organize a social life of their guests. I have a lot of posibilities for spending my spare time. The climbing and the painting are preferred by me the most. Generally I paint some landscapes by using the watercolours, but sometimes I try to paint like during the impresionist  by using blobs, oil paint and canvases. At the end I would like to ask what kind of clothes I have to take with me and how much money I will need for the normal life at the camp. I am looking  to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Report on making a interesting video film The aim of this report is to suggest which lessons and other activities should be place at  video film about daily life at our school. In order to preper it I visited some clasrooms during the lessons and I interviewed a number of students from our school. Some of the teachers are very good just profesionalists. Their lessons are valuable, rich in knowledge and funy. For example, the teacher of history and polish language is able to interest students about the subject in differents ways. According to students' oppinions the most popular activities are the basketball, tennis, swimming and as well the photography group and the painting team. It is surprising that 45 per cent of the students questioned frequent one of this sport's group and 30 per cent of people go to the photography group. On the whole our school have a lot of different possibilities for the students what we can show on our film. It can maks the video more interesting. I recommend to show our teacher of history. It can show that during every day we have a big fun and we recived a good, important knowledge. If we take under an attention this things our film is going to be very interesting ",22.0
50," Mrs. Jane Clark, I see your advertisement about  Internal Arts Festival now. I think that's a great idea. As we need some good activities.  Advertisement is written that you invite stars and artist from around the world. This is very incredible but from only six countries you wrote. I think you should invite  from ten countries because there are more and more stars and artists in the world. If you invite from more countries to stars and artist, your festival will be unbelieved.  Second point is there are some jazz, rock and classical concerts. It's a good idea but some concert halls are too small. Because of these, people are bored quickly. You show plays and films. I congradulate you because it's perfect. The most important thing is dance shows. As more people like dance shows, me too. That's the real knowledge for us, art exhibition and talks by writers. I think we know a writer life or how is he writing  it? it's  very significant thing. Lastly, you said 'one reasonable-priced weekend ticket for all events'. It's excellent. If you can pay attention to my small suggestion, next year I hope it will be  unbelievable festival. THANKS! Yours sincerely!  [SEP]  Dear Edmond I miss you very much and sorry about  didn't write you some letters. I hope you forgive me. What are you dong today, how is your school? My school opened yesterday. As you know I am a new student. It is very difficult because I don't know anybody. However; today I  used to my school, I have got two sweet girls. But this school has got a lot of rules and in our class, we have been talking about Rules, both at home and at school. It is very boring. For instance; you must not argue with your friend or you must not argue with workers. The most significant rule is you must not smoke in public places, or in the toilet. You continuously must study hard. I feel very bad because what you are allowed I aren't allowed to do at home. Are you understand me? Can I change my school? Please you will write me a letter quickly. Lovers! ",17.00
1178," Dear Mrs Smith, I am sad to read about Richard not being at his best. I hope that he will recover soon and that he will make it to our conference. As far as  organisation is concerned,  adequate number of double rooms with shower or bath have been booked for your group at the Palace hotel located across the main street from the train station. To come to our college, you can either watch downhill to the lake front (about 10 min) or take the new cable car from the train station. The college is just stairs away from the bottom end. The end-of-conference party will take place on a boat cruising on the lake. It will start by a speech from the Director of the conference, followed by a meal. The recreative part will begin at 10 pm with a short musical comedy performed by some of our students and end with fireworks launched from the roof of the college at 2 am. As nights may be cold at this time of the year, may I suggest that you take with you a pullover. Appart of that, there is no recommendation as to what to wear. Depending on the interests of your students, I would suggest that you visit the internet site of the tourist office: www.neuchatel.ch. yours sincerely  [SEP]  Where are you? is very often the first question that you will be asked when answering the phone. Why? Because somebody has invented the most popular communication device ever. The mobile phone. Once heavy, expensive and not reliable, the new mobile phone fits in almost any pocket and is given away by the operator to attract new customers. Due to the mobile phone. communication has changed, not improved. Of course it allows  to be reached everywhere (even in places you wouldn't want.) For rescue teams, it is a great help. But isn't it a handicap outside professional life. Shouldn't people communicate with those they are next to instead of calling someone 2 miles away. It is not rare to see two people walking side by side, both talking on the phone. Wouldn't it be better to prepare the shopping list instead of dialing home to ask which salad to buy. Mobile phone is a marvellous invention but as for cigarettes, we should right on it CAUTION: use of this device may damage your brain. ",30.00
735," Dear Helen Ryan: Thank you for letting me know about my prize  to Camp California in the USA. Here I will answear all the questions that you ask me, and I will ask you  other things that you dind't mention. I'll like to organize my trip in July because  is when I have vacations, also because  is summer time in  U.S.A, about acomodation at Camp I'll prefer  tents, because it's a new expirence for me and I'll like to sleep in  tents to have a great time at my new adventure. In my free time I like to play golf and swim, so I think that I'm good  playing golf. I play every saturday and Sunday  after that, I usually go to the pool because I love swimming, I think that those  sports I will like to practice at the Camp. Helen I will like to ask you how many money we have to take to the Camp? What kind of cloth  we have take? Thank you very much for your colaboration.  sincerely Teresa Reina  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable Most of the time when we go to the shopping Center we have a lot of fun, we go to stores to see  cloth, we also eat something like ice cream or French Fries, but not all the time shopping is enjoyable. Sometimes when we go shopping with someone who is not a good company, we usually don't have a great time, or when we know what we want to buy, but when we get to the store they don't have what we want, in that moment we neat to shop also when is an important day like Father's day or christmas every where we want to go and buy something  is very crowd so we can't find what we are looking for with calm because everybody is pushing you to the other place that you want to go In that cases is when we don't enjoy shopping because we can't find what we are looking for and we have a bad time in the shopping center.

976," Dear madame I'm very surprised about the good news and I'm sure I'll really have a good time in California. I'm happy to answer to your questions. First of all, I would like to travel in July because my boss won't let me free in August. Secondly, I would like to stay in  tents because I like camping a lot and I do it whenever I can. Regarding to the activities, I choose swimming and tennis. I'm a good swimmer and I would like to do it in the Californian See. I don't think I'll have the chance of doing it again in the future. On the contrary, I'm an absolute beginner in playing tennis and I'm not fit  in running but I chose it because it is a sport I've always wanted to learn BUT I'VE NEVER HAD enough free time. There is something I would like to ask you. What kind of clothes am I supposed to bring with me? And what about money? Should I bring cash or a credit card is all I will need? And what about sanitary precautions? I can't ?look forward to start this adventure. Yours sincerily Carla Reale  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable I'm a woman and they say that shopping is women's best activity. But I have a particular problem. I'm not slim and I'm a little ashamed of my body. That's why shopping is not an easy thing to do. In fact I can't buy whatever I like and I can't follow fashions just like the other women do. When I go shopping I always have to ask for the extra-large size and  harder to find it. I see a lot of pretty things but I have to quit the idea of wearing them just because I think that they won't look so pretty on me. And if this is a problem to me, imagine how bad a very fat woman (or man) should feel. Often they must go in special shops to by their clothes. It looks like a sort of racism and unfortunately our society looks for beauty. Just think about commercials. They're full of perfect people. The sort of people you will never find in real life. Will this ever change? I hope so, but, in the meantime, I'm on a diet. ",33.0
452," Dear Sir, I am writing to you to explain how was my experience  in the theatre last Friday. I did not expect to find all the problems that I had. Firstly, I would like to say that the actor who played  was not the same one that I read  in the advertisement. Secontly, the musical show began fourty-five minutes later and nobody explained me what was happened. Thirdly, I did not receive any kind of discounts when I payed although in the advertisement it was written . After the musical show, I went to the theatre restaurant but I could not have had dinner because it was closed. I think that if the musical show will begin later the restaurant should close later, too! Finally, from my point of view, I would like to receive the money that I payed because it was not the same as you offered in the advertisement. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. I think when you explain a secret you must be sure that you have chose the best person to keep it. In your life you will meet a lot of people and you should choose your friends. When I was a child my friends were my companions of class and, especially my neighbours. In the summers I always were playing with them on the street. When I was fourteen years old some things changed. I prefered going by motorbike with the people who studyied with me in the Institute. But, until you are twenty years old you choose your best friends. When you go to the university you are a person who can begin to make a good friends. You have an experience to know people and now you have an opportunaty to select good friends. You must select well if you want to have very good friends. For theses reasons, I think that you should know well the person who wants to explain a secret  and  keep it. ",24.0
463," Dear Manager, I have recently seen ""Over the rainbow"" and I must tell you that I'm really disappointed! I found the advertisement about this show in a newspaper and thought it would be fun. I like Danny Brook as an actor and when I read that he would be starring, I booked the ticket imagetly. But, instead there was a different actor, who I never heard about before! The show should start at 19.30, but it didn't start until 20.15! So, because of that, I missed my last bus home! While we were waiting for the show to start, we were thinking of going to the restaurant. In fact, it was closed the whole evening, because of some work . As I'm a student, I usually get discounts on different things, so I was so disappointed when I couldn't get it here! I'm really upset and disappointed after all this and at least I want my money back! It could have been a perfect evening out, but it wasn't! yours sincerely Karol Johannes  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed my daily life? I belong to this generation who had grown up with a lot of different technolgy. For example TV, telephone, micrown etc. But  the last few years, it has change and so many new important things had been discovered. What I'm talking about are the computer, which now can be found in almost every home and of course, the mobile phone! I tought I would never need a mobile phone, but my mum and dad gave me one for Christmas last year and now I can't live without it! But the discovery that I'm most thankful to is the computor and the Internet! Thanks to it, I can easy communicate with my family and friends at home when I'm here in England. It's so quick and not too expensive either. To use the mobile phone by the way, is very expensive. I usually use it for sending SMS Messages to my friends. So, I start every day,  swiching on my mobile phone, to see if there are any more SMS messages before I go to the library to check my e-mail and that's just the begining of the day...

265," Dear Sir, During a week's holiday I had in London, I went to see your last musical show called ""Over the rainbow"" at The Circle Theatre. I saw an advertising which  seemed very atractive to me. I have to say, it was not the best musical show. I think it was pretty bad. I had a very disappointing evening for many reasons. Firstable, I decided to come see your show to be pleased by the act of Danny Brook as I was so sad to find an other actor on the stage. Another thing was the hours. In fact, the show started at 20:15 instead of 19:30. It's enbelievable  to be late with 45 minutes. When I got to the tickets desk before the show to buy my ticket I asked for a senior discount, and the woman told me there were no discounts available  as I read on the advertising. After the show, I went to the restaurant to have a drink after all of these disappointments, but the doors were close because of renovations. I think you will understand  it was not ""my perfect evening out"" as you said, but one of the worth. For all these reasons I am asking you to give  my money back. Best Regards,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, in fact she was so bad at that she put me in such trouble. Once I was on vacation with her in America, in Chicago to be exact. We stayed together in a host family in the surburb of the city. We spent three weeks over there, the weather was great, the people we met  very interesting so everything was perfect. We had mostly a wonderful time. We went there 3 years ago and I had only 19 years old  as everyone know that the majority for beeing able to go out in the USA is 21 years old. If you don't have   the majority your aren't allowed to drink or smoke, or even worth to go in a bar. So one night Pat, who was 5 years older than I, and me decided to go out in a bar even if we knew I wasn't allowed in it. At the entrance, the security guard asked for  identity card, Pat gave hers and told him that I've forgot it  home. The man said it was OK for this time and we get in quite easely, we've made it. It was such a fun, we met a lot of different people, we danced, we had a wonderful time. After a few hours of dancing we started to be thirsty. We went at the bar and ask for  drink with alcohol. Of course by the time we get in it we forgot all the stuff about the majority. The barman asked me my age and Pat told him without thinking any time 19 years old! Then she realized but it was too late. The manager came, he called the police and the beginning of a great evening, ending with a night in jail and an expensive fine! Thank you Pat for keeping so well a secret!! ",25.0

191," Dear manager, I am writing this letter to inform you that the advertisement for the musical show was with wrong information. Firstly, the actors were different from the ones written in the advertisement which was very disappointing for me. Furthermore, according to the advertisement I was supposed to begin at 14.30 and 19.30 but it started at 20.15. Moreover, when I bought the tickets I was expecting discounts  available, however, there were no discounts available and the tickets were more expensive than the price written in the advertisement. When the show ended I went to visit the theatre restaurant I could not get in because it was closed as the chef of the restaurant was not there. I did not have a perfect evening out and I would like to have my money back. I am looking forward to hearing from you as soon as possible. Sincerely,  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed your daily life? Technology has changed our life forever. Nowadays life is much easier than in the old days. Firstly, we can cook our meals  an electrical stove or in a microwave and it takes just a few minutes to get ready. We do not need to lit  fire in order to cook as in the old days. Secondly, the doctors have found the cure for many diseases and many operations have been done in less time and in a painless way, by using especial machines doctors have be able to save more lives than in the past. For those who need to travel in order to make business with other people abroad can fly by plane and arrive in their destination safely or have their problems solved through telephone. To sum up, technology has been a great help to all of us. In the future, it will be able to help people even more since it has been increasing its capacity day after day. ",30.0

I would also like to ask  accommodation you offer are in tens or log cabins. If I can choose I would prefer tens. I like to sleep on open land and see the sun come up in the morning.

When I see some clothes in the window I like, I would go in and try them . But I always finds it  not look nice on me. The other thing I don't like going shopping is in the weekend. All the shops are full of people, and people treat the articals like rubbish. Hang them every where after they tried  and  that  was not suit them. Also in the weekend shopping. You do can't find some where to sit down comfortaly to have a cup of tea. Mc.Donnals, K.F.C, the all full of people.

386," Dear Sir, A few days ago, as I was having a week's holiday in London, I read your advertisement which convinced me to go to see your show: Over The Rainbow. I must tell you that this show was the worst one I had ever been to. First of all, I was very disappointed by the fact that the actors who played were not the ones who were supposed to do it! I was all the more angry as the show started at 20:15 instead of 19:30 as it was written in your ad! Another problem: there was no discount available! Finally, at the end of this very disappointing evening, I decided to go to the theatre restaurant - which was also mentioned in your ad - but I was told that this latter was closed because of a private party! To put it in a nutshell, contrary to what was explained in the advertisement, it was not my perfect evening out and that is why I would like to get my money back. I look forwards to hearing from you  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. When you told her something important, she could not help telling it to someone else so as not to be the only one to know it. Actually, even though she was seventeen, she still behaved like a ten year old child and it was very difficult for her to know that she could not do or tell something - like a secret for example. Thus when Sally explained  her that she had fallen in love with Kevin, Pat felt very embarassed. In fact, she knew that even if Sally was her best friend, she would not be able to keep such a secret. It might seem a bit strange but if Pat had been able to choose whether she wanted to know a secret or not, she would have prefered not to know it. Pat was totally upset. She felt all the more ill at ease as Sally trusted her. Thus when Sally asked her not to reveal the secret, Pat ran away, when home,  locked herself in her bedroom. But when she saw the phone that she used in order to call her friends, she started to cry since she knew that she would use it. ",34.0

Also the restaurant was closed because there was not left any food. I think the next time you write an advertiment you  write it with the right information.

Secondly, I think it is would be better to stay  tents, so than we can have a nice time at Camp California and find many interesting games to play in.

808," Dear Helen Ryan, the competition Organiser, I have recently recieved your letter  that I have won the first prize in the competition. It was very fortuanate of me. I would like to go to Camp California in the USA only in July as it is my summer holidays . It will be convenient for me then because I have two months holiday. I would like to do Tennis and Photography. I am in the team for tennis at school and I have played against different other schools before. I also enjoy photography. I am doing this subject for my G.C.S.E. so it would be very helpful for me to practise. About the accommodation at the Camp, I would like to stay in tents because I love to be outside and I like dangerous adventures. I can also then wake up in the morning and take photographs of the wonderful sceneries. I would like to ask you about what kind of clothes I have to bring and how much money I have bring. Will there be any shops? Please could you send me an itenerary of the trip? Thank you very much. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  I think that shopping can be both enjoyable and unenjoyable because sometimes the shops are full of people, especially at the weekends which normally is the only appropreaite time! Not only shops are crowded with people, the changing rooms have enormous queue. The clothes are quite expensive and they are never your size. These things can be very annoying but there is a good side of 'shopping'. I, personally enjoy shopping very much. I like to look at the beautiful clothes and I dream of wearing them. I find that shopping is a very good exercise as well! By the time you have completed the whole High Street, you will be out of breath. I do agree that shopping is not always enjoyable because of crowded shops and the price of clothes but I am sure that the majority of people do like shopping and I am sure that in the future, there will be no more crowded streets because of the 'internet'  which you can order onlines. Maybe we will have robots to do the shopping for us in the future! We all just have to wait and see... ",29.0
817," Dear Sir or Madam, I am delightful to receive your letter saying that I have won a two-week holiday in your recent competition and it will all  paid  in advance. I am writing this letter so as to give you the information which will help you organize all the necessary details of the forthcoming holiday. I would be grateful if you could arrange a date after the 20th of July, due to the problems beyond my control. Otherwise I will not be able to travel abroad. I would rather stay in one of the log cabins as I am allergic to many plants and insects and I should avoid contacting them.

I came second  last year's swimming competition and I have enrolled  photography classes. In the camp I can practise them alot.

Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I am terribly sorry not to drop you a line since the last time we wrote to one another. But I finally got around  writing and you'll see that it's definetly worth waiting  as I have some great and unbeliavable news to tell you. As you know I'm on half-term school holiday and have plenty of time to do much more different things apart from studying my A-level history, such as meeting up  my friends, visiting interesting places or even going to the cinema on my own. However this term has been a far cry from the others. You will see why I'm describing it as the most unforgettible one when you read through my letter. Couple of days ago I bumped into my best friend who is into music and we started to have a chat about what we had both been doing. She invited me to the rehearsal of a huge consert whose singer  was a well-known pop star as well as my favorite. Can you believe that I was introduced to him and I took numerous photographs some of which I put in the envelope. It was like a dream come true, and was the best part of the experience in my opinion. I helped out my friend by writing huge billboards and making some light refreshments. Despite the fact that I felt exhausted I must admit that it was one of the days I will never forget througout my  life write  me soon. Yours sincerely, ",35.0
1229," 12 June 2001 Dear Mrs Smith Thank you for your letter dated 8 June 2001. I hope I can give you the information you need. So the conference will be a great experience to you and your group. Your group will stay at the Palace Hotel. The Palace Hotel is situated in the town centre next to the railway station. A free shuttel-bus gets you to the conference-center. The bus leavs at 8 a.m. at the front entrance of the hotel. The end-of-conference party is playing in a rent and in the greenground. There will be a barbecue, a place to dance and many more. It is a surprice! I suggest to wear leisure-clothes to the party. The last afternoon you could go on a city-tour, visite the museum of Fine Arts or enjoy the beautiful flower garden next to the common park. I hope I could give you some ideas. I look forward to seeing you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  What would life be without the phone? Have you ever thought about a world without  phone? How was it in the 18 century with no opportunity  to communicate by phone and how would it be now? I can not imagine how our life would be. We are living in a busy world. In the business world you use the phone all the time to speak with your clients, to make appointments, to order an article e.c.; then, time is money! How has the phone affected my own life? I think, that is a good question to think about. I could not call my friends from an other city and just say ""hello"". It would be difficult and take more time to make an appointment. So, what did the phone-revolution for us? It saves  time. ",29.00
45," Dear Jane Clark, I am writing about  International Arts Festival which I went to recently. I had a great time there because taking a place the kind of festival in my town is very unusual. I think that  International Arts Festival was absolutely fantastic and successful. I was also pleased with the weekend ticket because I tend to go out in the weekend due to my work in the weekday so that I had time to go and did not have to care about the ticket price. In spite of having a great time, there were some things I would like to give you my opinion about. Firstly, there was a few stars and artists from only six countries although the advertisement mention that stars and artists would come from around the world. Secondly, some concerts took a place in really small halls. I suggest that concerts should be held in bigger halls than this year's in next year. Therefore, there will be more people coming  the concerts. Finally, food shops should be added in this festival in next year because only plays and films were not atrractive enought to get audiences. I would be grateful if you could consider my opinion above, Yours sencirely,  [SEP]  Dear Karrie, Hello. How are you doing? I've been also considering rules at home with my friends. Isn't it quite interesting to talk about rules? At home I'm not allowed to talk on the phone more than ten minutes, which annoys me very much. I really want to change this. However, I can go out wheneve I want, even in the mid-night. I'm also allowed to come home anytime so that I can chat with my friends for a long time instead of talking on the phone at home. There is a lot of rules at my school. Firstly, we're allowed to drive a car to school, which is quite  unusual rule in  Japanese school because students might crash a car on the way to school or home. I actually love this rule because I don't have to get up early if I have a car. Secoundly, boys are not allowed to have long hire. They have to cut their hair once a month. Girls can't  make up on at school at all. I want to at least put lip coluor on. I wish I could change this rule. I'll be grade if you let me know about your rules at school and at home. I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon. Best wishes. ",26.00
466," Dear Sir or Madam, I have recently been to the Circle Theatre to see a musical show. It was advertised as London's Newest and best musical show. However, it had been a very dissappointing evening for me. Firstly, it was mentioned that there were going to be two starrings but, in fact, only an actor were performing on the show. Secondly, there was a delay on the show which supposed to started at 19.30 but, it was actually started at 20:15. This really upset me as no notice were given before the show. Thirdly, the advertisment said that the discounts were avaliable but, the ticket seller said that there was no discount allowing or avaliable. In addition, the advertisment mentioned that  restaurant will be opened after the show but it was closed because, short of cooker. Finally, I would like to ask for  money back for the ticket due to the disapointing evening out and  unreliable advertisement you have created. I am looking forward to hearing from you as soon as possible. Yours faithfully, Cook Phatosub.  [SEP]  Nowaday, modern technology is becomming very essential to our daily life. As it is another important factor which affects our life, apart from money, health, food and house. The reasons it is important to us are, first of all, if you think bout life without computers, communication machines and transportation machines. We wouldn't be able to sort out informations and datas this quickly. Secondly, no one could communicate on the phone through countries or even through houses as immediate as nowadays. Lastly, it would take people months and months to travel to the other side of the world and also the journey would be much more dangerous than travel by plane. Without all this you life would definately change back to the same position as it were 50 or more years ago. Put it in another words, modern technology has changed our life to became more advanced in every ways. On the other hand, the affects that it has on our daily life is not always good as sometime, the technology went wrong and out of hand of people who control it can cause disaster accidents, for example: plane crashes, trains crashed and  explosion of nuclears bomb. If this continue to happen our life would be very misarable as accident happens all the time. Therefore, it is important to get it exactly right. ",19.0
317," Sir/Madam, I am writting this letter to inform you I had a very disappointing evening during your musical show ""Over the rainbow"" at the Circle Theatre where you are the director. First of all, the actor was expected to be Danny Brook. He is my favourite actor and the most important reason I went to your theatre. But finally, without telling us anything, there was a different actor. This was very disappointing. Secondly, your famous restaurant was closed. That was very displeasured because I had planned a romantic dinner with my wife. If you had told me your restaurant was going to be closed, I would have made a reservation anywhere else, but you didn't. And finally the play started with a delay of forty-five minutes and there were not discounts available. Both things do not agree with what I read on your advertising sign. Due to all of these reasons, I hope you could give  my money back. Yours sincerely, MANUEL ALMODAR  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. But I didn't know that when I told her I was thinking in going away from home. This was a very difficult decission but I had to take it because of my personal situation, all the time shouting and fighting will all my family. Therefore my girlfriend lived alone so I could have stayed with her or just have gone on travelling around the world. I was thinking a lot about this problem and how to solve it so I needed someone to talk to and Pat had always been my best friend. But it was a big mistake because she told it to her mother and I don't know how but now my mother know  it, and she is very worried about me and my future. And my father thinks a year travelling and living by myself will be very good for me. Finally, my parents are all the time argueing about differents solutions to my problem, and this all thanks to Pat. ",34.0
1166," Dear Mrs Maria Smith, I am afraid to hear that Mr. Brown is ill I hope it won't be grave. However, I will be glad to give you as much information as you need and I hope you will find it helpful. the name of the hotel in which the group is going to stay in is  Palace Hotel, to get there you must go to the centre of town, all  buses are going there, Once you are in the centre Palace Hotel is right in front of the tourism information office. For the end-of-conference party we have booked one of the halls of the hotel and they will provide us  life music and cattering. Due the hotel is such an elegant place I would suggest to dress up in night clothes. Finally, to fill your free afternoon I would hardly recomend to visit the cathedral and have a walk arround the old part of the city, if you like it will be my pleasure to show you the souroundings. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Chairs are not only part of the forniture, they are also objects of decoration and you can even find some in museums as art symbols. Who could have invented such a useful item? In fact, nobody has got this clue, but it must have been the most clever person on earth! the world is packed with so many tipes of chairs, from the common woden ones to the most sophisticate and comfortables others finding a baste range of prices. From my point of view the chair is without a doubt the most usefull gadget ever invented. Some people use them in their work, others are wishing to get  one by the end of the day and for some other people a while chair represents the possibility of mouvement. Although  is worth to say that not everybody can chose his ideal chair there is a special one for each of us. ",25.00
598," 13th June 2000 Helen Ryan Competition Organiser Dear Madam, I am writing in response to your letter, in which you told me I am the winner in your competition, and my intention is to try to give you all the information you may need according to your letter. I would like to travel in July because I had another trip to Spain in August, that is the perfect month for me, otherwise I would not travel to Spain. About accommodation, I would prefer  tents instead of  log cabins and the reason is I have never used tents and this could be a very exciting experience for me. The two activities which I find  better for me are swimming and sailing. I love the sea, that is why I became interested in those activities since I was ten, therefore I have a lot of experience in both. Could you give me some advice about the weather in California? Thank you very much for everything. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully, ION GAYARRE  [SEP]  13th June 2000 Dear Kim, Thank you for asking about my latest good experience, I  let you know what the important details were. As you know I helped at a pop concert last month, I did things as unusual in me as cleaning instruments, organise people, and also look after the clothes of the artists. In fact everything was very easy, the instruments were already clean, and with the clothes my job was only wait there and give them what they asked for. Organise people involved, just a couple of things, say to people how to do the same as me and when. The most exciting thing was to be able to speak to the singers, the whole environment, and of course to the listen to the Concert in the very first position. All that I can say now is that I would do it again, I will never forget that day. Looking forward to seeing you, Best Wishes ",25.0
867," Dear Helen. It is so nice to hear the news from you that I have won the first prize. I'm looking forward to getting sun-tanned under the sun in California. Here are the information which you asked me for. I would like to travel in July, because it is the only month that I will be able to take off days. Also my kids have school holidays during this month therefore I hope to travel in mid of July. I'd prefer to say in log cabins. Because our family had some bad experiences with using tents. Whenever we used a tent, we had bugs or the rain dropped inside the tent. It was very difficult to choose only two of those fascinating activities, but I made a decision, which is Golf and Photography. Since my hobby is taking photos I am very interested in this field and have studied by myself about it. But Golf is an absolute new trial. I can imagine myself playing Golf in those beautiful Californian golf-courses. Even though I'm poorly skilled. Especially I wonder what else I have to pack to go there. Inform me if I have to bring special dresses or only outdoor clothes, and also if it is necessary to bring some money for me. Thanks Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dearest Kim How are you? I wish you are fine. I'm fine either but I'm quite busy to find another part time job after the one, which was the concert supporting  one. I remember that you asked me to tell you about that job. It was fantastic but a bit hard! First when I got there I realised that I was the only woman and I had to work in the box-office. It was quite terrible when I had to let people leave, because all tickets were sold out. Then the concert started, I was called from one of the staffs for help, finally I could get into the stadium. The next work I was gives was ironing costumes. Can you imagine that I touched all of the costumes the singer wore? It was a pity that I had no chance to learn how the sound system works, which I was mostly interested . But it was terrific enough to hear the band performing and to see the audience's reactions, meanwhile the backstage couldn't even join that fantastic atmosphere. What I really liked was that every single person had to be responsible for his role, till we left the stadium. And that mad the concert absolutely perfect. I wish this is enough to express my feeling and I hope someday we can share such things together. Stay pretty and lovely! Kisses from  ",30.0

Firstly, Palace Hotel has been booked into for the group accomodation and I spoke with the hotel manager for traveling to the conference. The hotel has their own buses, they will pick us from  hotel to the conference saloon. Secondly, I would like to tell  more about  end-of-conference party. I booked  Palace Hotel's restaurant for our party and it is big enough for your students. It is going to be very lovely and enjoyable because I have lots of surprises for  students. In addition, I suggest that they should wear sporty and comfortable clothes. Finally, you would like to know  some activities for three hours  free time. I think you can go to the 'Dreamland'. In this place there is video games, some little competitions and  small zoo available. Students can enjoy their time in this place and it is on the way of the airport. I look forward to hearing from you. Your sincerely,  [SEP]  To: American students group leader From: ...

I would like to describe 'Anitkabir' Findings 1. This building's name is 'Anitkabir' and it is the biggest building in Ankara. It built in 1953. It is placed in the middle of the forest. There is different kind of bird and different kind of trees present. 2. It has  very big museum inside the building and all  building made from stone. 3. This building's security guards are very special soldiers. Their aim is to protect the building from the enemies because there is also  very big army museum available. 4. It has no charge for entrance and it has a good view for tourists to seeing Ankara from the hill. It opens at 8.00 am to 5.00 pm Recommendations I recommend that it is the best building in Ankara to visit because it includes all Turkish history and very good sight seeing. ",25.00
46," Dear Jane Clark, The reason I am writing this letter is to congratulate you for the International Arts Festival. I think the festival was fine but in my opinion there must be some improvements to make this festival better. Firstly, there were stars and artists only from six countries. This number may be increased to attract more and different people. Also some concerts holls were too small for this much people. In contrast with the halls, the concerts were great and I saw everybody enjoyed then. I must admit that you are very successful about finding good stars. The films and plays were not so many. As a result of this the kinds of films were not enough. In order to attract more people with different interests, the films and plays should be increased. I have nothing to say with the dance show, art exhibitions and talks by writers. They were excellent and they attracted any kind of people. Another paht is the tickets. The weekend ticket is excellent because it is not so expensive and it allows  to see everything. But I was disappointed that there were no competition between the films performed I think there should be an Oscar-like competition in order to make people more ambitious to make better films.  [SEP]  Dear Elinor, I'm so glad to receive your lost letter because I've started to think that you were angry about me for not writing for a long time. I promise I'll write more The school rules are horrible here. We are restricted  to do nearly everything. The school is like a dungeen here. I don't went to be so evel about school but the rules are rules and they are limiting us with the borders of our school. We must wear the uniform-like clothes all the day and  week They don't even let us to wear different sweaters - etc other than dark blue. It is boring. We are not allowed to compare our thoughts during the lessons becase the teachers think that we are chatting. How poor their imagination are!! However we are free at home. You could do anything you like as long as you have good grades. If you don't, you hear the same word every day, ""Study, Study, Study""! Nobody likes to study but we have to. You can't imagine how happy I am and I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon Love, ",30.00

First, you asked abut the travel time and the only possible time for me is in July, because my company only gave me holidays  in this period. Second, I prefer accommodation in  tent. I want to feel the real nature and spirit of Camp California. Further more, I should choose between two activities and  how good I am at each one. I choose singing and surfing, singing because I am a singer in a band and I hope to make my voice more perfect and surfing because I have never surf and I want to learn to. Finally, I have some questions. I would  know what type of clothes I should bring with me? How much money should I take with me? Is it possible to travel with a friend of mine? Yours sincerely Marlene Berg  [SEP]  Dear Kim, How are you? I hope  fine. Me, fine, because of helping at the concert  'The Dome'. I can say that this was one of the best experiences of my life. First I have help to cook coffee and make food for popular people like Mariah Carey, Elton John, Backstreet Boys, Echt ect... Before and after the concert the ""stars"" are very hungry and I have serve them food, drinks and something like this. Kim, check it in your mind, I have had near contact with Mariah Carey! I am so happy about it. Different ""stars"" gave me signatures and talk really nice and normal with me. At the time the concert was running I cleaned the kitchen and the room where the ""stars"" ate. The after show dinner party was very nice and I have never thought that popular people like Elton John dances on the table if he likes the music and if he have made a great show on stage. It was just great and after this event I can say that popular people are normal humans like everyone ! Love, Marlene ",24.0

199," Dear Sir/Madame, I am writing to complain about your musical show which  performed last Friday. I was interested in your advertisement and I booked the friday show while I had been on holiday. However, this theatre made me disappointing from starting the show until  finishing. First of all, I saw that the discounts were available, but there were not any discounts and advantages for the audience. Also the show started at 20:15 delaying for more 45 minutes than the advertise mentioned. I could bare it by the time. Moreover the show was awful. I like Danny Brook and Tina Truelove's acting but he actors were changed without mentioning, also the restaurant was closed by the excuse  to be repaired. In fact, the notice had been showed since last winter. It means that the theatre have not made any efforts for the people. In conclusion, I was very disappointed in a whole of the show, furthermore, I could not enjoy my holiday after the show. Therefore, I would like  to refund some money. I look forward to recieving your prompt reply. Yours faithfully, Sun-Young Lee.  [SEP]  Fashion of the Future. Return to the Nature. The World is being Changed rapidly by developing technology and industrial. It affect   lots of ways. One of them is   fashion area. people think that we will wear a simple, practical, light clothes. For instance, we can see that kind of clothes in sci-fi films like Starwars. however, in the other hand, there is a different idea. People like designer's clothes like Armani, Chanel..  so on. They prefer new original style in order to show them more attractive. Moreover, most designers prefer to use natural material. They have used animal and fish skins, some plants and herbal things  than chemical one. In my opinion, people want to wear special and original clothes to show their own characters. Also countless fashion will be shown. People will prefer to use more natural than chemical things and wear more beautiful and attractive clothes. I think that showing their beauty is one of animal's basic instincts. I can't stand wearing a suit or kit like  which has been showed in Starwars! ",25.0

I would like to travel at the end of July, because at that time, I will be finishing a degree in Arts. I am concerned that you offer me the chance to choose two activities, while I am there, because of my studies, I will take painting as this is the subject which I am finishing at the College, allways with important cualificaitons, and photography subject which has been my hobby since I discover that I can mix in practise paint and photo. Concernet to acomodation. I would prefer a tent since for me if I go to a camp or and excurcion it won't be the same if I slept in a cabin. Finally I would like to know if I will have any extra cash for expenses, I mean food, or will I have to bring it with me? Will I have to bring my own clothes or you will give it to us? I look forward to hearing from you. Your faithfully  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable. Some people seems to enjoy going shopping and spending money, it makes them happy but what about the ques you have to make to pay for something just to realise, when you get to the front, that they have to close that till and they ask you to move to the next till, what a waist of time. It happened to me once that I wanted to go on holidays, so I went to the travel agency. in the front there were some good advertisement about holidays which were very cheap. I really liked one of them concernent to Spain for 3 days with hotel and breakfast included, but for £250. I went inside to asked for that packet but they told me that it was gone, therefore, I went to many shoops just to find the same answer. any of the adver. in the windows were available. However, the most important thing is when I asked them to take that adver.  of the   didn't do it. As and advise try to go shopping in the out pick hours, and don't waist your time asking for promosion advertised in the windows of the shop. ",24.0
122," Mr. Circle Theatre's Manager I am writing to you complaining for the Play you are advertising as the ""London's Newest and Best Musical Show"" in newspapers and leaflets. To tell you the truth, it has been the most disappointing experience in my whole life. I cannot bear  when somebody says something and then does just the opposit way. To begin with, I would like to inform you, in case you do not know that the play does not start at 19.30 as it says . What is more it lasted 45 minutes of waiting  to start and  did not supply all the expectations people had. On the other hand, despite the fact that you said that it was starring by Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, I must tell you that Danny Brook did not appear at all. Instead of him there was another actor who  neither act nor sing, and, even though, it was a Musical Show. The last thing I would like to complain for is that the Theatre Restaurant was closed because, as it said, of ""VACATIONS"". If in the advertisements and leaflets says ""VISIT OUR THEATRE RESTAURANT AFTER THE SHOW"" there are not reasons for  being closed. It should be opened at least until all people gets out of the place. It must be our decission whether to stay and eat there, or not. To make it shorter, because of everything I have said before, the correct thing to do for me is to ask for my money back, and for you  is just giving it back to me because of all the troubles and disappointings feeling you made me suffer. I am looking forward to hear from you as soon as possible.  [SEP]  HOW HAS TECHNOLOGY CHANGED OUR DAYLY LIFES In times of our grandparents life was so different, that we cannot beleive that this huge change to our day life happened in only one hundred years or less. First, we have to admit that technology has really increased the access to communication, traveling and geting information. You can now know what happens on the other side of the world, at the same time  it is happening. What is more, you can get the information you need in just one second by pressing the ""enter"" key in a computer. Furthermore, as we all know, day life now a days is quite simplier and an example of this is that instead of buying a peice of ice to cool drinks (as our grandparents used to do) we not only have a refrigerator but also a freezer in case you want it faster and cooler. Strange as it seems, we now can have every  machine or especialized technology to make our dayly life more confortable and less workable. Things that human beings used to do, now are being done by computers and machines more efficiently and rapidly. One the other hand, despite the fact that technology make things easier in our day life, the same happens in industries and companies where they use computers and machines instead of people. As people do not get a job because  is not needed they get into poorness, criminal activities, being isolated and without the possibility of getting a good education. This is the most terribly disadvantage technology has. With advantages and disadvantages, technology is in our life and may represent an advance for some and a bad thing for others. Things and technology changes every day our life, our jobs, our way of face the world, this is what differences both centuries, our grandparents' changes lasted to long to change human life. ",23.0
369," Dear Sir or Madam, I saw your advertisement yesterday. I have visited the circle theatre. I would like to say that I am not satisfied of it. First of all, there were any different actor. I was disappointed. The other point is that the organization was very bad. For example, it is said the show starts at 19.30 but it started at 20:15. I have waited around one hour. Now I have a cold because it was so cold  evening. Thirdly, I would like to enquire is about the tickets. Firstly, twenty pounds are a lot of money for such a organization, on the other hand it is said that  discount is available. It is false, I have paid twenty pounds. What other I would like ask is that why it is said this is the London's newest and best musical show. I can mention it is the worst musical show. And I was invited to visit the theatre restaurant after the show. But it was closed because there were not anything to drink or to eat. Finally it was not the perfect evening out. In conclusion, I really did not like it. I want to ask if it is possible to give me  money back. I look forward to your letter. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Modern technology has changed my daily life very much. At the present, the technology develops rapidly. In my opinion,  World can not do without it. Firstly, I would like to mention is that in our daily life we always use some technological machines. For instance,  TV-set, stereo, microwave oven and others. Another point is that with the help of the technology we can communicate with the whole world. Without doubt,  discovering of the computer is the most important technological event. It is very useful. Almost everything is connected to the computers. For example, education, researching of the Universe and others. Another thing I would like to say is that modern technology help us to go anywhere  rapidly. The most suitable examples are the planes. What other  I would like to mention  how important the modern technology is . We research our plant, other planets and many other things with the help of it. Finally I think that at the present the life is more comfortable . In my opinion, no one can do without modern technology. It go on to develop and always will be the most importand think in our life.

870," Dear Ms. Ryan, Even if I worked hard on it, I was very surprised of winning just the first prize. At the moment, I'm worried of about not being able to enjoy it because I have recently achieved a new job and I started working just three months ago. For this reason I am afraid I won't be allowed to chose the period for my holidays. Consequently I hope that  is possible to join the camp during the last two weeks of July, when the company I work with suspends its activities. As far as I am concerned, I would prefer an accomodation in a log cabin, but in case there are no cabins left I can stay in a tend as well. As you already know, I am trying to become a professional photographer, consequently I would choose photograpy as the first activities and painting as the second. However I would like to know if by any chance the photograpy activities are only for beginners. In this case I would rather do some climbing, which I have never done before. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  - Shopping is not always enjoyable -. In general, shopping is considered a pleasant activity. Actualy most people work hard to earn their money and consequently, the occasion in which this money is spent to buy something useful, or simply something they like, should be considered a very pleasant situation. In fact, the shopping you do for the daily needs is seldom enjouble, as it is clearly more a duty than a pleasure and morover you are often faced with some nasty situations. Shops and markets are often noisy and crowded, you don't know where to park your car, shop assistants are rude and sometimes they don't know how to do their job. Anyway if you can choose the time and the place, and if you go shopping just because you like it, and not because you need it, shopping can be a very nice activity. Personally I don't like dealing with shop assistants and looking around the shops, so I buy all what I can using ""on-line"" services. God bless the one who invented the Internet! ",31.0
749," Dear Mrs Ryan Thank you for your information. I am very happy to win this prize but also I have some questions about this Camp. I would like to know if it is possible to travel to this Camp on July because for me it is the best time and I can not travel before or after  according to my employer. While this two weeks I would like to stay in  tents because you can be nearer to the nature as you are on  log cabins. I like to go camping. From the activities I choose Basketball and Golf. In Basketball I am very good, because I have played in a Basketball-Team for ten years. But in Golf I am a beginner. I would like to know if it is necessary for me to take some clothes with me for the sport activities? Also I would like to know how much money I should take with me. If you could tell me this answers it would be very nice. Yours sincerely Aydo Ackermann  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable I think shopping is not always an enjoyable thing because there are a lot of things which are not good . For example: you need a lot of money each month for shopping, and a part of this money is only for buying the necessaryiest things like bread and other things to eat. I enjoy shopping when I can buy some clothes. Also a problem while the shopping is that most  there are so many people and a lot of traffic in all  shopping-centres. All the people are there most on the same day because there are not a lot of other possibilities for shopping while the week for the employees. I think one possibility is to buy your things on the internet, because then you have not to invest a lot of time for buying all this things, and they bring you the things at  home In the end I think it is the best if you have the possibility to shop when there are not so many people because then you have enough time and you are not stressed.

464," To the manager of the Circle Theatre in London I'm a tourist and I had a week's holiday in London a few time ago. I had enjoied to see the musical show that the Circle Theatre presented some night ago; and the actor's Danny Brook performance. I went to the theatre at 19.30 o'clock but, with my surprise, the show started at 20:15 and so I couldn't remain here until the end because I  left London, with my group before the end of the show. The star, the actor Danny Brook, there wasn't in the musical show but there was an other actor, with my great disappoint. Then, in the program I could read  a discount available for the tickets, for the groups, but I couldn't have that. I couldn't have all the things I expected. That evening was terrible for me and for my friends, so I'm not satisfied about your informations and I ask  some money back. I hope in your answer and in your explanation about this. Your Sincerely  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Some days ago, when the school was ending, Pat and her friends decided to make a party for their friend, Frances, because the end of the school  and the Francis's birthday were  the same day. That might be a secret for Francis - and they decided  the program and the present, a new gold watch. Peter and Sue asked to Francis  some help for their exam's subjets and Francis, for to help them, was very busy all the week. The last day all the friends went to Pat's home with food, musical instruments,   tape recorder. Pat was very excited about this. In the afternoon she had phoned at a Francis's mother and she explained her the secret, then she phoned at her best friend and she speak about that too; she phoned at many people all the day. Now many people knew the secret but Pat said everyone: ""I  tell you a small secret, but you don't speak , please!"" In the night Francis was invited to the party, at Pat's home. When he was out he needed to buy some cigarettes so he went to the shop where the owner, a his friend, ask him if he was very happy about his present, the new gold watch, he was very lucky to have best friends like Pat and her friends. The Francis's secret was discovered! Now all the Pat's friend don't tell her about their secrets because Pat isn't very good at keeping secrets.  ",23.0
655," Dear Helen, I've just seen your letter and I'm really delighted to have won the first prize in your competition. I would like to travel in July because it's the only month I have two weeks holiday during the summer. I would prefer to be in  log cabins because I feel insecure staying in  tent. While I'll be at the Camp, I would like to play tennis and  swimming. I've done it for many years and I want to do both once a day. I'm very good at swimming and my level  is medium at tennis. If possible, could you let me know what I'll need for example which clothes I must take and how much I can expect to spend. I'm excited to  go on holliday there and thanks to you, I will realize a dream that I always wanted to do. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I want to tell you about my good experience I had last month. I'd enjoyed helping at a pop concert and it has been fabulous. At first, I'd helped them to carry the material and we had fixed everything in the good order. They were so many pieces that we had spent a whole day to prepare the scene. At the end, we have had a beer and we talked together. I was astonished to see so friendly and funny they were and we got good friends. During the show, I was behind them and I could see the spectators shouting and jumping with their and up. It was unbelievable to realize that I'd worked with stars and that they were my friends. It is difficult to explain what I'd particularly liked about my experience because the most memories are in my heart and I'd never thought that I could get on so well with a group of people which I'd known only for  few days. If possible, I would like introduce you to them, they are very nice guys. Best wishes ",31.0
206," Dear Mr Manager With reference to the show last week. I am writing to complain about the show, which was very disappointed. In the advertisement, it state that the actor for this show is Danny Brook and TINA TRUELOVE. As a result I asked my acquintance to come with me to the show. As soon as the show started. I realised that the actor wasn't DANNY. I was very disappointed. In addition the concert didn't start on time. It was  quarter of an hour late. If I knew that the show was going to be late, I would ask my mom to come with me, because her working hour ended at eight o'clock. The restaurant was closed after the show ended. On the other hand there were no discounts available, as a result I had to paid extra money for the tickets. In conclusion it wasn't a perfect evening, I didn't enjoy it at all due to the failure advertisement. I would like to ask for my money back. Your sincerely Thatt Chitchee  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. As a result Mallory had been arrested by the police two years ago. In addition he had to serve a life sentences. The story began in 1989 in New York. Mallory and his partner, Pat had planned the best plan in the world, which was to steal the diamond from the national bank. As a result the only way to get into the building was at the top of the build. Their plan was to cut the alarm from the top of the building. The alarm was situated at the top. So they could take their time, rather than going in at the front door. As soon as Mallory stole the diamond. He ran away. Unfortunately the guard saw him. By the time he got out of the building, the cops was ever where but as long as Mallory is alive, he won't be arrested, with his unpredicatable mind. He ran into the old build, and hidden a diamond in there. Unfortunately the building was a police station. ",25.0
769," Dear Ms. Ryan, Thank you very much for your letter regarding my prize that I won in your competition. It was a very pleasant surprise to win a trip to California and I very much appreciate it. I am writing this as a reply for you request to provide you with some information about my preferencies. First off all I'll prefer to travel in July, because it is the only month I have free. I'll have to pass several exams in June, in August my family going to visit our relatives in Austria. I am not so keen about  accomotation but would rather stay in tents than cabins. It is much more fun and you can really enjoy nature and a company of your friends. It is great I can do something I really like at the Camp. I am really enjoying swimming. We live near the sea shore and swimming is the sport activitie I am really good in. Far the best swimmer in my school. The other subject is photography. I like taking pictures and want to share my interest with the others. I am not a photographer but my family think that my photos are more then just good. Finally I want to ask you some questions. What will be better to take with me, what I'll need at Camp? How much money should I take, will it be any guided tours? And how many will be in  Camp in July? Hope to hear from you soon. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable. My best friend is crazy about shopping. She will prefer shopping to everything else. She thinks that it is the most pleasant  spending of time, when you going from one shop to another, watching other people, looking at beautiful clothes, getting some fashionable ideas. Somitimes I feel very sorry for her. It seems that going shopping is a sense of living. And it's so many people like her. Lots of families planing a day out to go to a shopping center, and it is a normal routine for them - to spent the all day just shopping. Not so many people thinking about going fishing or playing sport games with their families any more. They forgot how beautiful could be the countryside, and only tourists you can meet in the castles or museums. People are normally angry after shopping - because it is so easy to get tied. People are not smiling to each other, not talking to each other at the shops. They look like a robotes who have to do their duties - to buy. In my opinion shopping is just  to cover our basic needs. Shops are not for spending our lifes in them. Try to give up shopping one day and try to spend your day with friends going to play something together. It feels much more better. You'll have happy memories and  a good mood. ",27.0
789," Dear Mrs Ryan, I am writting to thank you for your letter confirming the first prize that I won in your competition. I would like also with the present to give you some information about me in order to arrange the details for the trip. First of all, I would like to inform you that I will be able to travel only during July because in June I am going to give examinations for the First Certificate in English. Furthermore, in August I will be preparing for my course at the University which I am starting next September. Secondly, I would be grateful if you could arrange for me accomodation in log cabins as I am not used on living in the countryside and especially  in tents. In addition, I would like to inform you that I  prefer to do Surfing and Sailing while I will be at the Camp, as I am an active member of  Sailing and Surfing Club of Manchester and it will be a great chance for me to practise my techniques and skills. I would be also grateful if you could send me information about the average living cost at California as I have to arrange the amount of money that I am going to spend, and some advice about the clothes that I need. I would like also  to specify if the food is including in the prize. Please let me know if you need more information. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  As requested, I visited some classes during the lesson and some other rooms while activities were taking place. The aim of this report is make a series of suggestions on which lessons and other activities should be filmed. It's seems to me that it will be an extremely good advertisement for our school if you take plans from the lesson of Chemistry in the laboratory, because our laboratory is new, recognised as one of the best in the area as it has a huge amount of instruments and really some very good professors, and also many experiments are taking place in this laboratory Furthermore, I think it will be a good idea to take plans from a match of our school team in the football field as it is completely new and full equiped. In addition, I think you have to take also plans from the school's Nursery as there are a lot of facilities for the children, and the parents can recognise that the teachers are very good. I think also that  will be a good idea to take some general plans of the school area as there is a huge background. In conclusion, I have to declare that my myself and my fellow students will be available to help to this short video by all means. ",32.0
979," Dear Helen Ryan I am very impressed that I have won your competition. As the letter said that all questions you would like to know, I'm going to give you in the following: Firstly I would like to travel in July only because I have two months holiday which are July and August, I choose July because it is the only one month that I think I'm free. In August I have to work so. Secondly I prefer the tents because I've never been in that tent so I would like to try. Thirdly for the activities I would like to chose climbing and photography, I have never done them before. The only reason is I would like to try and I think they are matching activities, when you climb up the mountain then you can take the photograph of the views. Eventually I would like to ask you, are about money and clothes. How much do I have to bring the money? And what is the weather like? which  I could bring them to be match the weather. Yours sincerely Sintawichai Chaow  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable Shopping is when human goes to the shop and buy what they went, however I think this word is for women because they like beautiful clothes  all sort of things. Anyway shopping is not always enjoyable as the title  because firstly you will get tied because you have to walk out and in the shops. Secondly you will get angry on  bad treatment of the sellers in the shop. Thirdly if you're fat you won't find you size. Forthly that product is too expensive for you and the last problem is you buy to much things but you have not got your own car so you have to carry big boxes by your self. I think if you have lots of money and don't know what to do with it, do not go shopping give the money to charity, that is better than shopping. For me my opinions on this one  is true it is boring, it might  because I am a boy. ",23.0
390," Dear Sir, I am writting in order to complain about the musical show  which name is Over the Rainbow that I could see in your theatre recently. I like very much this musical and while I was spending some days in London I could see you advertisement so I decided to go to see it. First of all I had problems with tickets because I could not get the discounts that you mentioned in the advertisement. It was a pitty but it did not annoye me because I thought that the musical was good enough to pay £ 20 . So I entered to the theatre to enjoy the musical but I do not know the reason why it started at a quarter past eight (three quarters  delayed). Then I got nervous and I thought that the organization was very bad because nobody explained  us the reasons  . Finally, when the musical started I realized that Danny Brook, my favourite actor, was not there. In your advertisement his name was in main letters and in the musical the actor was different. After the show I decided to go to drink a coffee and to smoke a cigarrete to try calm myself and suddenly I could see that the restaurant was closed because it was the free day for the barman. I am very indignatged because I wasted my time and it was a horrible evening so I would like you return my money and take notes of all these problems. If you do not return my money I will send a letter to a lawyer. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  HOW HAS MODERN TECHNOLOGY CHANGED YOUR DAILY LIFE? A long time ago technology wasn't an important element for people because they didn't appreciate it. Change weren't a normal situation and Governments didn't invest enough money on it. Nowadays, technology is changing our life every day. For instance, modern technology is changing the way I work. My computer is faster and it is able to do a lot of things on that I wasted a lot of time before. Not only are the computers useful for keep information but also computers can give you a lot of information due to  Internet. On the other hand, I realized that modern technology not is as good as people think: I hate mobiles. I know that some people need them to work but I can't understand why teenagers need it. To sum up, modern technology is changing my work, my life, and my friends. Maybe it would be a nice idea to analize these changes and to put limits to technology, because I think that the most important  is  our life and no the ways we  improve it. ",28.0
1025," Dear Mr Robertson! Thank you very much for  good programme! We like it very much! But we would like to go to the London Fashion and Leisure Show. It is on Tuesday. We think, that you also would like to go there, when you'll know about it better. There will be showed the latest fashions. Also, we will see leisure and sports wear. We know, that you wanted to have another  and didn't know which one. If we go to the show, we will see many hairstyles. Maybe it'll help you choose. Also, you'll be glad to know, that for students it is free! So, we think, that it is very good as for you as for us. So, we can change your programme a little bit to the best one. On Monday afternoon we have the river trip to Greenwich, as you have written on your programme. On Tuesday morning we go to the show and after that shopping. And on Wednesday morning we go to the national art gallery, but after that we can go to the Science Museum, in the afternoon. Our class asks you to think about this programme. We're sure, that you like it very much!  [SEP]  It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. My best friend told me, she met one boy. She liked him very much. She was speaking about him every time. She told me, that he was hansom, kind,  well-understanding (he understood her from a half of the word); the main  was he also liked her very much! I belived everything she has told me. And said just to be careful. But in three days she hasn't been at home. She disappeared! We called the police. They advised us to wait. But we couldn't just sit and wait! We had to do something. In three days of her disappearing the phone has rung. I took the phone. Someone told me if I wanted to see my friend, I must take 5000$ and bring them up to the street. I took any papers, put them to one bag and without saying anything went to my friend to take something  like  gun. The friend gave me his toy  and I gone to the street. There I saw a man and my friend. I showed the man, that I had a gun and money. I  surprised that he belived me. Of course, it was better for us. I gave him the bag took the friends hand and we run away. After that she told me, that the man was the boy, which she met. Don't believe everyone! Better check, if you are not sure! ",23.00
1105," Dear Mr Robertson, I wanted to thank you for allowing us to have this great opportunity to visiting London. I have read the programme and I find it very appealing, specially because of the River trip to Greenwich. However, I have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and I was wondering if we could visit it. The show is going to be at the Central Exhibition Hall  the 14th of March from 10.00 to 19.00. There will be shown the latest fashions, leisure and sportwear, some make up and also different hairstyles. The students are  free so we won't have to pay for the visit. We all think this is a great opportunity to learn more about London daily life and what people like to wear. I suggest visiting the London Fashion and Leisure Show on Tuesday morning and visit the Science Museum on Friday afternoon. We all hope you would consider our suggestion. Yours Sincerely,  [SEP]  Almost everyone hates other people gossip in their private things. It's a natural reaccion to be angry with somebody you don't trust for gossiping  and bothering your personal thoughts. So I think famous people, no matter if they are politicians or films stars don't deserve being followed by journalists every time they are trying to have a good time. I thing that  journalit's only aim is money, be cause they know that if they publish famous people's private life they would earn lot's of money selling the magazine or the newspaper. But they don't consider the problems the romours may bring to the famous family or couple. Sometimes the journalit's aim isn't the money: there are some journalists who may try to spoil the politician's or film star's career only because they are jealous. In conclusion, no matter which or what the journalit's aims are, famous people deserve to have their problems, their affairs, their private life just as normal people have. ",26.00
260," Dear sir or Madam, I was one of your customers who had a very disappointing about Over the Rainbow show at your Circle Theatre yesterday. First of all, these starrings of the show were not Danny Brook and Tina Truelove. The only one reason I bought your ticket was because of Danny Brook and Tina Trulove, as your advertisement had shown. But your starrings were not . I bought a ticket for the 19.30 round and the show was very very late. It started at 20:15 and that waisted my time and made me feel bad about your service. And also the ticket discounts were not available. That was not your advertisement had shown. And finally, your restaurant was not available after the show. From every singular things I have complained, it was totally different from what your advertisment said. And because of this, I would like to ask for my money back. If you see that this is a good reason, please telephone me. My telephone number is 123-4567. Yours  [SEP]  Thesedays we are living on a high-technology world. Modern technology has been growing rapidly and it has effected me a lot. Indeed, I have to save more money for upgrading my personal computer. Computer technology keeps improving all the time and consumes like me and you definitely have to pay our money to keep our personal computer up to date and able to work with  new computer softwares that require more and more performance of computer hardware. Anyway, modern technology such as the Internet changes me a great deal of life-style. Using the internet, I can search for almost all  information I want to know. And I can send e-mail to my friends via the Internet fastly and cheaply prepared to the old-style mail-services. Finally, I think modern technology makes me do my business faster, smarter  with much more efficiency. ",25.0
421," Dear Sir/Madam, I'm writing this letter to complain about a musical show which I've seen on last Saturday. I went to London to see this musical but I was absolutely dissapointed about the show. I got to the theatre at 18:30 because I wanted to  drink before I get to the hall so I got there earlier. The show was supposed to start at 19:30 but it started at 20:15. It was about fourty five minutes later than  original starting time. I was just a bit upset but I wasn't that upset much at that time. The thing which made me really upset was the actor. The actor should be Danny Brook but it was another man who I haven't seen before. I liked Danny Brook so much and I was expecting to see him but you didn't even mention about  that actor was going to change to another guy. This thing shouldn't be happened. After  finished watching the show I went to the restaurant which you advertised. It was about 21:00, I thought it was  bit later but it wasn't my falt anyway. The show was finished at 21:00. When I went there the restaurant was closed. We couldn't even get any sandwiches. I'm so upset to say anything anymore and I want to get my money back which I paid for the show. I look forward to hearing from you before I do my futher reaction. Your faithfully Ann Kim.  [SEP]  Fashion of the future. Nowadays, we have millions  styles of fashion and every single person has their own fashion. Fashion became a part of our life and some people think that what clothes you wear is  most important thing. We spend lots of time to choose clothes or shoes. A 100 years ago, people wear much more diffrently. Women worn dresses and men worn suits in England. It was very formal fashion, but now people wear more sexy clothes than 100 years ago. Fashion keeps changing. Therefore, in the future fashion might be changed a lot. I think people will wear metal clothes like  Robotcap. The enviroment will be very polluted and finally we'll get desease. We will need helmets to cover our head and we will also need air-supplyer. May be, science will be developed and make our enviroment clean,  we will not wear anything at all!!! (except under wear). I hope that the enviroment will be better than now in the future and our fashion will be changed but nobody knows how it will be. We should try hard to create new fashion and suitable fashion in further days. ",24.0
663," Dear Helen Ryan, I received your letter and would be glad to travel two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. but I will only be able to go in July for in June I will be in Austria with a friend and in August I have rented an appartment with my family. I would rather be accommodated in a tent because I already have the necessary material for camping. While I am at the Camp I would like to play tennis and do photography. I play very well tennis since I have played it since I was a child but I am a novice in photography and I would like to try it as I have always been interested in it. I would like to ask you a few questions: What kind of clothes should I bring? Will you give clothes for  activities? How much money should I bring there? Faithfully Yours, Pascal Fritz  [SEP]  Although many people enjoy shopping, shopping is not always enjoyable. You can fall on a very disagreable sellor and if you find what you wanted, you will not want to pay him or her for it. Sometimes the seller might even ignore you as he or she is talking to another sellor. For example, you walk into a shoe store. Two sellers are talking and although they saw you enter, they continue their discussion so you have to interrupt them. Then, one of them serves you but half listens to you because he or she is still talking to the other sellor. There is nothing more disagreable than that. Also, when you find a nice sellor and he shows you lots of objects, when you don't find what you want, you feel sad for him or her because you made him or her lose his or her time so you feel obliged to buy something. All this  to say that shopping may seem enjoyable but often is not. ",27.0

During the week we descide where we want to go, we all agree to listen to music so than we descide to come to your musical show and listen to ""Over the Rainbow"". That evening we don't want to have our supper before the show Anyway I though it will be too early to eat and also because the time table or canidates you give me have say: ""visit our theatre restaurant after the show"". so we did, but unforturnily it was close and I was so dissapointed about it, nor only that we have expected Danny Brook and Tina Truelove to be the actor of starring. Also I don't really mind that the show start late but the rute of that evening was rucented. And there were no discounts when you say there is! Why is it every thing that on the canidates were wrong and different  what we had. We don't expect much bad to happened in our hoilday, but this was  perfectic show as well, it was the worstest show and theatre I have never been  in my life. P.S. please would you like to explain why ? We would like our money back please because every thing gone wrong, the atmosphere totally chanced! sincinerly from Ki  [SEP]  Modern technology changed our daily life In order to live happily the sciencetist can easily perdict the changes on earth, so than we can have time to perpare or defence our self from the Natural diseasters. Wapons were designed to kill and defences in a fright, in War 1945 so many German were killed, also many people die from other region. e.g. The Englishs. Posin chemical compounds e.g. gases, liquids, are created too, they were use to kill people, most of them give radiration which can disable the person, mostly harm their brain and their bodys and it could also cause deaths. Communication techology e.g. internet (networks), moible phones. In the wars soilors were communicate with moible phones though places to place to get or give information about them self and the enarmys. By using  internet we could make new pen friends oversea,  creat club, sociatys. Now  megsage can travel quicker and it is also world wild. send letters takes about aweek to HongKong from  U.K., but net work eg. E-mail. is much faster. require  time is about few minutes. Now we could even create a club in Yahoo, which is free.

261," Dear Mr. Brown, My name is Anne Singler and I have already watched the musical ""Over the rainbow"" in the Circle Theatre. I'm writing to you because I wasn't pleased with the show! In your advert for the musical show you promised the newest and best musical show, but it wasn't. First I was very disappointed about the price of the ticket because I expected to pay a smaller pice than £20 for my six year old daughter. Then the show already started at 20:15 and not at 19:30! I was quite bored, sitting in my chair and waiting for the beginning of the show. For me the most disappointing problem was that the starring Danny Brook wasn't there. My husband was also looking forward to seeing Mr. Brook as an actor of your musical because he is one of his greatest fans. The actor which acted instead of Danny Brook wasn't as good as Mr. Brook. After the show, which wasn't really the best I have ever seen, my family and I wanted to get some snacks in the theatre restaurant. When we arrived at the restaurant we had to realize that it was closed because the cook was ill. After this last point of troubles we went home with only bad remembers of this evening. So I want to ask you for giving me my money back because I think I  have better  spent my money on anything else. I hope you understand my point of view and write back. Yours,  [SEP]  The secret Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. One day her best friend Sally told her that she had betrayed her boyfriend. Pat was really shocked to hear this but she had to promise Sally to keep quiet. Pat really liked chatting about others and so she wasn't able to keep quiet about Sally's secret. She told it to her boyfriend Paul. After that Paul got white in his face, he was pale like a wall and it seemed as he would be very nervous. Pat couldn't understand Paul's reaction and so she didn't care about it. Some weeks later when Pat was walking to school she met Sally, which just came out of Paul's house. Now Pat realized what was going on and could undstand why her boyfriend got so nervous about the secret. He was Sally's lover! In this moment Pat wished that she never would have been keen on knowing secrets! ",29.0
213," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to you to complain about my unpleasant experience of visiting your theatre on May 21st. I had dreamt about visiting the Circle Theatre to see Danny Brook's performance for a long time. As soon as I saw your advertisement in the 'Tourist Guide' issue 46, I decided to go at once. However, all my expectations failed to become true. First of all, I found that no discounts for tickets were available. Although you mentioned it in your advertisement. Next, the show started at 20:15 instead of 19:30. And, finally, right before the starting they announced that Danny Brook woud not be in the show that evening. So he was replaced by another actor. After the show I was not surpised at all to know that the theatre restaurant was closed for redecoration. As a whole, I have to say that I got something completely different from what I had expected to get. In connection with that I ask you to refund the money I paid for my tickets. I really hope it will not take you long to settle the matter. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Undoubtfully, modern technology changed my daily life. And the best word I can  describe all the changes with is ""drastical"". Every aspect of my life is being constantly influence by achievements of science and technology - health, work, household, interaction with other people, etc. Among the greatest inventions of man I came accross dayly are  telephone, computer and automobile. At any time of a day I may contact any person at any part of the world over  phone. It takes me less than a minute to get in touch with my friend Nigel living in Australia - thousand  kilometres'  from me. Computer, probably the must versatile invention, allows me to get an access to huge informatonal sources through the internet, to make shopping without leaving my house, to do my work more effectively and quickly. Automobile saves my time when I'm travelling. All the above and many other achievements of modern technology make my life more convenient, comfortable, effective and fun. But it is not the end. Scientists continue researches into new technologies, such as lasers, digital technology,  gene engineering. And I'm sure all those will set new better standards for my way of living. ",28.0
14," To: From: I spent two days at  annual international arts festival from 21 to 22 of November. This festival was well-orginised. There were a lot of activities for everyone. I relly liked  exhibitions. I had a chance to see amazing pictures with wezy painted by Russian painters. There was an excellent jazz concert. The Band ""Three Kings"" apresented  new stily of music. I would like to notice that a dance show was absolutelly marvelous. What's a greit idea to invite writers there! I relly liked to speak with them. From my point of view I can complain only on a small concert hall and  there were artist from only six countries. Nowadays many people  fond of classical music, but this concert was too small that's why many people had to miss this classical concert. You wrote an advertisment  that people from more than 15 deferent countries were going to visit this concert, but there were artists only from 6 countries. It was relly  pity because I expected to see artists from France and Italy. The International Arts Festival was organised quite well. I would only recomended you to have more artists and a classical concert should be in  bigger hall than it was.  [SEP]  One man and one woman lived in  small house beside the sea. There names were Ivan and Maria. They were so pour that somitimes they hardly had something to eat. One day Ivan caught a fish. It wasn't  usual fish, it was  Gold Fish and it asked him as  human; ' Please, let me go and I can do for you anything you want'. But Ivan was so kind person that he let Gold Fish went without  any condition. Afterwards he came back home. He told her wife about this story. She was angry and she said that Ivan was just  foolish man. She persuide him to go to the sea to ask  a lot of things for her. Ivan had to do what she said. Gold Fish did everything what Ivan asked. When he come back home, he was surprise because Maria was more angry than before. She said that it wasn't enough what Gold Fish had done for her. Ivan had to beg Gold Fish again and again. In the end, greedy Maria wanted impossible thing. She said that Ivan should bring Gold Fish to home and Ivan could leave this house because she didn't need him anymore. Maria wanted too much and Gold Fish returned everything at the beginning. Maria and Ivan were again poor.  This story happened a long time ago. ",24.00
591," Dear Sirs, I cannot express how happy I was reading your letter about the prize I won and about 2 wonderful weeks I am going to spend at Camp California in the USA. With regard to your questions. First of all, I would be very happy if you could arrange my trip and stay at the camp for July. I will still be at school in June, and I am going to spend the whole  August on a training camp with my club. July is really the only available time I have. If possible, I would prefer to stay in a log cabin. I spend 3 weeks in a tent last year and it wasn't the best experience of my life. I would like to avoid tents if possible. You offered me a really wide range of activities to choose from, but I would have to go for basketball and tennis. I can say it with confidence that I am quite good at basketball - I play it for my school's team and I am going to train  it in August as well - I don't want to loose touch with it. Tennis is just something new that I recently discovered and I am still on a beginner level. It seems like a good oportunity to practice it. Finally, I would appreciate  if you could send me some information about the weather in California at this time of year. I am a little concerned about the clothes that I should take. Does it rain a lot there? Another thing is money. How much money do you think I should take with me? Will you arrange a place where I could keep the money secure during my stay at the camp? I look forward to hearing from you and I can't wait going to  USA.  Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  ""Shopping is not always enjoyable"" In my humble opinion, shopping is one of he most stressful and boring activities people do in life. If I was asked to choose the least attractive thing that I have to do on  everyday basis, shopping would most definitely be placed somewhere on  top of the list. If it would be possible I would rather have someone else doing shopping for me. First of all, I don't like and don't enjoy spending endless hours pushing my trolley (which, by the way, has it's own idea of where it want's to go) between other desperate people baskets, just to find that perfect tin of beans or a toothpaste. Especially that it is so hard to find anything in a modern, huge and stuffed with lots of merchandise department stores. Secondly, if you happen to forget something, you will have to force your way back through crowds of other shoppers, and that can take up even more time. But the worst thing comes at the end. Your visit to the shop conludes in a long queue to the checkout (where you can easily spend another 30 minutes) where they will suck out some money from your account. Where's the fun in that? No. Most definitely shopping is not an enjoyable activity and I can easily think of many, nicer ones. ",34.0
951,"  Miss Helen Ryan, I was receveid your letter concerning two weeks at Camp California in the USA. So I will answer you about this different points. I would like to travel only  July because I think, it's the best month for  enjoy my holidays. About my accommodation, I would prefer a log cabin because it's more confortable than a tent and less hot with the sun. Nevertheless, I hope, there are water and light inside this log cabine. Between your different activities, I will like to practice: 1. Surfing because I never do it and I will like to learn it. 2. Photography because during my freetime I make some pictures about persons, country, -- - So, I will want to have more experience and a better technique to succed at a good level. Nowthere, I would like know if it's possible to change my activities during my sejar. Can I change some moneys in the Camp or near it? Is it possible to come with another person? And know the different prices for the same holidays? Thank you for answer my different questions. Salutations.  [SEP]  The shopping is great when you have lots of moneys,  times; you can buy clothes, shoes, make-up; CD, whatever. But, it's not easy for workers, because the shops close their doors about 5.30 pm (half past five). When you work in a office, a manufactory, a society, you have the same planning to them. So you just can go to do a shopping during your lunch break. If not, you can go the Saturdays but  badly,  there are too  costumers. You can't walk,  try clothes ,  it's very hot. The salewomen are too busy and haven't a moment for give you a counsil service. In England, there aren't paper for make a present. It's different than the other European countries. Sometimes the sales women aren't friendship, because they have some stress or they aren't the sale feeling. Finally I think, it will be better if the shops stay open until 7.30 pm (half past seven). It will be a good service for their costumer and  more cool for them. ",18.0
526," Dear manager, I am writing to complain about the musical show that has recently taken place at the Circle Theatre. The advirtisement I had read did not match the performance. First of all, Danny Brook was not starring and was replaced by a different actor. That was very disappointing. The performance started fourty five minutes later. Moreover, I was unpleasantly amazed  no discounts were available. Furthermore, I would not have complained if the theatre restaurant had been open. According to the advertisement, I could visit it after the show, but it was closed because of the lack of customers. My ""perfect evening out"" was not so perfect and could not satisfy me in any way. From my point of view, the partial refund of the cost of the tickets, which are enclosed with this letter, would completely satisfy my interests. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed my daily life? Modern technology has  variety of uses and its possibilities are being widened more and more. Today it is used practically in all spheres and its influence on people is not unnoticable. Personally I feel the greatest influence from the side of personal computers. Their popularity could be explained by their comfort and easy use. With the help of  ""Internet"" it is possible to get much objective and useful information you are interested in. Computers take  the major part of my free time and this is the reason of disagreements between me and my parents. They would like me to go for a walk more often or to help them in their daily routine. I am completely satisfied with the way I spend my freetime, but they have another opinion. In conclusion, modern technology affects everybody, but in different ways. The only effect on me is more often disagreements with my parents. ",29.0
945," Dear Sirs, Thank you, it's great to hear for about my winning. You ask me for some informations - here they are. First I can do the travel only in July, because I can't get  freetime in any other month. The next thing is, that I would prefer a log cabine. I don't want to sleep in a tent, because I'm afraid of snakes and similar animals. About the activities during the Camp I can tell you, that I like to play Tennis and I do it very good. Another thing I want to try, if possible, is to play Golf. It's a very favourite sport also in our region (area), but I did never found time to do it. I'm a beginner in Golf you have to know. Now a question from me to you: Is it possible to pay  the different things with credit-card? Another question - what sorts of clothes shall I bring with me? Is July a hot and dry month or is it raining sometimes? I think, this will be all I want to know. If there is any other question from your part, please call me or write again. I'm looking forward to hear from you, yours sincerely  [SEP]  Hi Kim, sorry, I'm late I know, but now I will tell you something about my experience last month. The concert started on the 15th of may and it was a real great session in our valley. I was so happy when they told me to help them with the organisation. I was responsible to the advertisments and I had also to invite the ""important persons"" from our governement. It was realy a new job for me, but I think, I have done good. I've learned a lot about management and especially - how stars are living. One evening we went all together out for diner and after we visited  our new disco. We arrived at home early in the morning - it was great. Now Kim, I will finish my letter but I promise you to write again as soon as possible, maybe if I've developed the photos of the concert and the stars and the .... A good idea at least - you come here and I tell you some other story's. In the meanwhile enjoy your life - love ",34.0
556," Mrs Helen RYAN Competition Organiser USA 13th JUNE.2000 Dear Mrs Ryan, I received your letter in this morning and thank you very much for your kind letter and  chosing me. I can only travel in July because I had already booked and fully paid for a middle-east holiday, from 25th of July till  end of August. If you can arrange my departure time from 1st of July it should be convenience for me. I would like to stay in  tents because I had much great times in tents during my previous holidays, if it is suitable for you. I want to do this two activities while I am at the camp: Sailing and photography. I have great experience for sailing. I used to work for a sailing company in Turkey. And I have done  certificate for using  radio (VHF). I have knowladge about navigation, engine , ropes and knots and  sails as well. My other passion is photography, especially I like black and white photography. I have a camera which is a called Minolta X300. That is a manual camera. I know  to develop films and print them. I have doubt about clothes, money and  immigration rules of the USA. please could you write me how is the weather like there, what kind of clothes I need and how much money I should have. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours Sincerely.  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable. I like shopping but I had a bad experience about my recent shopping . I went out for shopping and to get some ideas about new brand computers and  products. First of all I went to a local shop but I couldn't find enough selection of products. Then I visited another one, in Cambridge Street. It was very crowded, I could hardly walk in the shop. I decided to by a CD room driver for my old computer. When I approached to the cashier I suddenly noticed my wallet had gone. My money, travel card and credit card . It was a nightmare there were pickpokets in the shop. I went to the shop assistance but it was useless. As soon as possible I phoned to my bank for cancelation of my credit card but they had already used it. it costs me about £500. This experience has changed my shopping habit, now I do all my shopping on the internet. But I'm not sure how it is safe. But you must be always award against to pickpokets. ",32.0
223," 17th June 2000 Dear Sir or Madam, On 14th June 2000 I went to see your ""Over The Rainbow"" musical show and I have a few points which I would like to bring to your attention. Your advertisement was featuring ""Danny Brook and Tina Truelove"" as the main characters but in fact some other people replaced them that evening. The time mentioned on the tickets was 19:30 however the show started at 20:15. As I came to London on holidays and purchased ""The London City Guide"" I saw your advertisement explaining that people could buy discounted tickets for £5 in advance. Well I tried to do so but the lady at the desk told me that they were  quotas  available at that price but were already sold out! After the show we tried to go to your restaurant but unfortunately it was closed for renovation! I was very disappointed of my supposed ""perfect evening out"" to your theatre and due to all the above-mentioned reasons I am asking for a complete refund on the two attached tickets. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  MODERN TECHNOLOGY ""Technology"" is an appealing as well as an interesting word for me. From ancient times up to now this science has allowed the world and human-beings to develop positively and negatively. Egyptians, Mayas, Incas, etc. were civilisations with great knowledge because they were mastering most of the science fields we deal with today. Back in the 30's the different governments invented guns, battleships and all kinds of weapons for their armies. The military technology has affected our lives more than what we think because most of the equipments we use were originally created by those people.  The fast and growing computer industry is giving us less and less physical work due to a mechanical concept. Biotechnology is providing us with the latested discoveries to heal or improve the human body to  its most efficient state. Transport means are also part of the overall technology and allow us to go faster, further than before with less effort. Besides all those improvements and confort I can't stop thinking where all this will lead us. I am keen on technology because I believe it should improve our lives however I dislike the idea that such a science might fall or had already fallen in wicked hands. ",36.0

798," Dear Mrs Ryan, I have just received your letter informing me that I won a two week holiday at Camp California, so I am writing to you to indicate  my preferences for the travel and the accomodation. I have no particular needs but one: it will be necessary for me to travel in July because my work will keep me very busy in all  other months. About the accomodation, I have no problems, but I would prefer staying in  tent, so that the holiday may be more adventurous. During the holiday, I would like playing tennis and golf. I can play tennis quite well, but I have never played golf, so, if it is possible, I would like taking lessons with a teacher. I would like to know also what I will have to pay  with my money and how the climate is at Camp California, because I have to decide which clothes to bring. I look forward to your answer. Yours sincerely, Clara Mancini  [SEP]  People often have very different opinions about shopping. Most women and girls like it, especially when they want to buy clothes and shoes. A man usually is less interested in shopping, maybe because he frequently has to pay  what his wife has bought. In my opinion, shopping can be interesting in big stores, where you can find everything, or in shops which sell something special or strange. On the contrary, I don't like going to shops where you see only common things, and I hate it when there is a lot of crowd. In this case, you have to stay in long queues, you can't walk without being pulled or pushed, and you often have to spend a hour to buy some soap or a packet of biscuits. Even if you are with a friend, you can't talk, because of the noise and the confusion, and you may find it difficult also to walk close to each other. The better thing to do to skip queues and crowd is not to go shopping on Saturdays, but it is not always possible. ",31.0
363," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writting to complain about the musical show at the Circle Theatre. Firstly, the actors who starring was not Dany Brook as it was advertised but one other actor, whose performance was very bad. That made the show disappointing. Secondly, the show should began at half past seven. despite these fact the show began at a quarter to eight. Also, there was not available tickets  and after these bad musical show the restaurant of the theatre was closed. My evening was not very pleasant as you advertised. As a result of that I demand to have some of my money back. Yours faithfully,   [SEP]  If I say that technology has not changed my life I would be lying. If fact technology change in a major point my life. Can you imagine your life without a car or a television? I don't. Technology  so much  my life which I could not live without it. But technology doesn't only makes my life better. By the use of  car I do not only get an easy way to move , but I  destroy my enviroment. Also, if I use the car, in small distances when I can go on foot, I destroy my physical situation. Could you imagine your life without a television or a computer? I could not. Althouth with the computer I can contact with my friends and with the television I relax, I could not find another way to relax and contact with others. Technology is very important for my life. It makes my life more easier, and it would be much more difficult to live without it ",22.0
1080," Dear Mr Robertson, First of all, I am writing to thank you for organising  school's trip to London. The programme seems to be really interesting, especially visiting the Science Museum. However, the students in my class have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show, which is going to take place on  14th of March at  Central Exhibition Hall. Visitors will be able to see the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear and also get some help with make up or hairstyle. It would be  great opportunity to see this show, because we are all very interested in  fashion subject. What is more, admittion for students is free. Do you think that it would be possible to change the programme of our trip? In our opinion we could join the show on Tuesday, after visiting the Science Museum. It would not be a problem to go shopping on Wednesday in our free time. I look forward to hearing from you. Your sincerely,  [SEP]  Famous people, such as politicians and film stars, deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time. In these days, when we can see  picture of  famous person almost on every first page of the newspaper, it's a quite common topic . First of all, I think that famous people deserve to have  private life. Journalists should not follow them all the time, trying to make an interview or taking an 'interesting' picture. Secondly, I can really understand how annoying or depressing it can be. I think that deep inside famous persons are just ordinary people and like for all of us having a private life is important for  psychological condition. On the other hand, we could say that they decided to have such kind of life. Maybe they need to pay the price for being rich and popular? Maybe sometimes they need to sacrifice their privacy? In conclusion, I think that it is very hard to find an answer to this question. However, everyone needs to have some part of his life being a secret. ",33.00
19," Jane Clark Organizer of  International Arts Festival Dear Sir, Mine name is John and I have been in the latest International Arts Festival. The purpose of this letter is just to let you know my opinion of the event. First, I would like to congratulate you for the success you have been having year after year. Nevertheless, I have some suggestions that may be profitable for next year's Festival. The artists you brought were only from six different countries, so I think you should next time try to offer us people from more different nationalities, to make it more interesting than it is already. Moreover, I have been thinking about changing the location because, as you probably already know, some concert halls were not big enough to let everybody who wanted go in. Finally, I just would like to recommend you not to give up showing movies, during the Festival because the crowds were amazed with that, and keep on offering the current prices, one of the best deal for us, the spectators. If you would like to talk about my suggestions, please, do not hesitate  and let me know. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Independent Student Magazine Here is my article. There are many ways to earn money, specially in a big city, like the one where we are studing all year around. Some examples could be delivering pizzas or newspapers, working as a bartender throug the nights, cleaning services, etc. I usually call these jobs non- cualified positions. I think, as a consecuence, that there is no difficulty in finding a job for our spare time. What it really makes us, the students, upset, is to find the perfect job. To be more technically and specifically, we need a very flexible job, wich gives  independence and allow us to stop working when we are not able to, for example during the exams period. Moreover, and I know that that point is not easy, although we are still students, the most suitable job for us should be a position related with our carreer. Next year I expect myself finishing my studies in LAW. And by that time I will have already some experience, so that I will more easily  able to apply for a really good job. So, Why don't we think more about the future, instead of being upset of how to get some money to spend  next party? ",24.00
22," 16.12.00 Dear Clark, I am writing to response to the international Arsts Festival, which took place on 21-22 November. I would like to inform you, that it was a great idea and  valuable activitie as a social event. However, it was a dissapointment, when I realised that not many countries were attending to the event. I could be fine if I had seen more countries from all around the world, for instance:  far east, indonesia etc. It wasn't complicated to find the right hall to the shows, I should say it was very well organised. But one thing, I have to mention is that some of the concert halls was too small and it wasn't comfortable as well as to fell the great atmosphere. On the other side, I enjoyed to being on of the people to see the plays and films,  dance shows which was brillantly performed -  art exbitions. Listening  talks by the famous writers was a opportunity which I couldn't missed. I would like to ask, if you could expend the plays and films more for next year? I have to add that the weekend ticket was a ideal idea to sell all the events. Finally, I preciate your organisation and look forward to hearing from the next International Arts Festival.  [SEP]  16.12.00 Dear Nico, Its really nice to hearing from you and thank you very much for the letter with photos. Its a good idea to send them to me, because I have to confess that I have lost my camera and also the films. What a pitty! By the way how is your new school? Did you like it more than the previous one? I must say that our school rules are quite different than yours. First of all we have to stand up, when we speak to the teacher and have to pay full attention to the lessons. If you missed a lesson, that could be a trouble for yourself. I think it depends on the school. Privat schools have  more relaxed atmosphere that the state school. They don't have strike rules and students can take extra lessons. On the other hand, in the state schools as I said, we are more respectful to the teacher and bad behaviours are punished. For example, you have to do more homeworks or they are sending you home etc. Of course smoking isn't allowed at any part of the schol. I have a relaxed family and we are sharing all the houseworks. My Father does the cooking, my mother does the cleaning and I do tidying up! But in many Families women are doing more than men. I can't accept that, because you have to share all the duties and spend more time together. Anyway it think that's it for now. I hope to hearing from you soon. Lots of Love ",24.00

I can enjoy this gifted prize only after  7th of july, because before this date I will be in Jamaica doing a English course. I have been traveling around Jamaica for a year without any conpert due to an inclination for adventure, so I would rather you provided a tend, I don't mind. From the 10 opitions that I have to chose  I will chose two, climbing, wich I have been praticing for three years and because that I know by heart how to do it, and swimming wich I have also been doing every day in my daily rotine in Portugal. I would like to know about wich sort of close I have got to take? And I also would like to ask how much money I have got to take. I hope that  after jully won't disturb the Camp California's plans for me. Allreggards  [SEP]  School days As known, every body have to spend all the childhood and youth at the school, because  that everybody have a similar daily life such as, wake up, got to the school, study and the best, meet all the friends. A survey has been done, and the issue is, wich subjects (lessons) and activities the students thinks are the most enjoyables. Someone says it is maths, pratical, usefull  but the majority says it is boring, unless you're chose a job which charges all your math's knowledge  as accounting, otherwise you can use a calculator or a computer. The majorite has chosen History, which means a big journey around the world, either at the Roman life style, or in the midle age, when a revolution happened with deaps and new lands. People must get some rest often, and as a result they look forward  some happiness at the free time such as, party, games, and every one loves party , it should have been filmed. At all schools there is a similar daily life wich must be filmed, this is a important part of our life, wich is full of emotions in development. ",28.0
615," Dear Helen Ryan; Thank you very much for your letter and for this competition. First I would like to answer your questions. I am only available on July, is it fine for you? Because, the only time I can take  holiday is July. I would prefer log cabins, I think they are more comfortable and safer than tents. About the two activities I choose swimming and painting. I choose swimming because I am very good at swimming and I like it very much. I took swimming courses for four years. And the reason I choose painting is it's being very exciting to me, I am not very good at this subject but I would improve my painting. I would like to ask whather you have competitions or different activities? Do you reccomend me to take only summer clothes or some winter clothes as well? Is it  very expensive area? I mean would £700 be enough for me for one week? Thank you very much for your interest I look forward to hearing from you Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Kim, It's been a long time not to write to you, I'm really sorry but I was very busy. I worked untill midnight everyday. Actually I don't work, you know, I had been decorating a concert hall for a pop concert. It was very important for us because we really wanted people to enjoy it. It was very enjoyable I met lots of friends We'd been together all day, painting the walls, cleaning  putting  some baloons and other staff everywhere. And at the time of  concert we wore a big funny costume, and danced with people. Everybody liked it very much, Anyway we worked for that. The most I like was meeting with the band. Guess what the name of the band is; Back Street Boys. Oh, my God they're so nice, talkative, funny, people. But you know they're a bit spoilt. I have to finish or I'll miss the last post.

854," Dear Helen Ryan, I have received your letter today and I would  to thank you for the first price. The best dates for me to travel, would be in July because actually I work in the communication firm and I must ask to my employer when I can take holidays. But I think it will be from the 7 July 2000 to the 21 July 2000. For the accommodation at camp, I prefer in the log cabins, because  few years go, I went camping with some friends and every night it rained and in the tent, it was impossible to sleep because the ground was so wet so for this fact, I choose the log cabins. For the two activites that I chose are at first swimming, I am in the Swimming Team and I must go two times per week to entretain me because I have  competition every weekend. My second choice, it is Basketball. I have played basketball at school and I was one of the best player after that, I decided to coach a team but I should stop because I have started  swimming competition. For these two weeks, what kind of clothes I must take? It is including the transport and travel, but for the food and extra hobbies I must take some money. Could you tell me approximatively  Your sincerely M. Bruni  [SEP]  Dear Kim, How are you? I'm fine. You know last month I helped at a pop concert as like security. It was a very good experience. The concert sarted at 6:00 pm  until 2:00 am, and I started to work at 12:00 pm to prepear the scene with the musicians. After that, at 2:00 pm, when people arrived, I was at the entrance to take the tickets and you know it was incredibale because some people slept all the night in front of the stadium to be in the front row. There were maybe 50,000 spectators for this show, it was amazing. When the concert started I had to look round if anybody threw bottles or something else on the scene. I also helped to serve people who would like drink, I was like a barman. I saw old people, child.... and for me it was very strange and it was very interessting, because I met a lot of people and the best thing was that I knew the pop group who sang, it was fantastic. If I had an other opportunity to do that I think that I will do. Write  me as soon as possible.  ",26.0
837," Dear Sir or Madam I have just received your letter. I was glad to know I had won first prize in the competition and I am writing to reply for the camp. First of all, I would like to travel in July because I have to return to my University in the middle of August. Your another consideration was accommodation. I think it is more comfortable to stay in log cabins than in tents, so I would prefer log cabins. According to your letter, I can choose two activities to do at the Camp. I would like to choose painting which I have been doing for 12 years and tennis. However, I am not very good at playing tennis, so could you tell me if I can learn at the camp? Please could you also let me know if I need to take special clothes with me? I would be grateful if you  phone me or send me a letter again at your earliest convenience. I look forward to the camp in the U.S.A. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Cry Freedom 'Cry Freedom' is about the blacks and whites of South Africa. The main characters of this book are Stephen Biko, a black leader, and Donald Woods who is a white newspaper editor. Woods is thought to stand for all of white peope and this book could have an influence on them. In the first part of this book it can be seen  Woods is not on the side of the blacks although he didn't approve of the government's attitude to them. In some ways, he did not agree with ""Black Consciousness"" which is Biko's organization because it was too much against the whites. Woods thought he knew the black society quite well and understood their ordeals, but after he had met Biko and visited a black township, he realized he had been completely unaware of the way they had to live. The people and the circumstances he experienced in the black township were such a new world to him. Finally he changed his ideas and started to work for the blacks using his skill as a journalist, in other words, he became an activist for the black people of South Africa. Although Biko was killed and Woods himself was declared a banned person, I would dare to say their sacrifices were worthwhile because Woods succeeded in escaping from South Africa which would enable him to publish his book revealing the truth about South Africa to the world. In short, Cry Freedom deserves to be recommended and once you read it, you will want to read it again. Most of all, this book will make you think about the prejudice you have. ",37.0
1151," Dear Maria, I've recieved your letter asking me for further information about the conference that you going to organise very soon, here yo have a little help for it. At first, I'd like to tell you that the hotel where you going to stay is ""The Palace Hotel"", wich is situated at the center of the town. It can't be difficult to find, because  is very near of the conference. Also there is a bus provided for the organisation to take all the students at the hotel. At the end of the conference it will be a party. I might suggest you to wear a casual dress, because many students feels  relaxing after the whole day sitting and listening all the conference. The party is amazed by a group of musicians, and as I remembered from last year it was unforgiven, because all the people where dancing and having a lot of fun. It is a well-situated town with a lot of museums to visit especially ""the History museum"" wich I visited last year, and I think you can enjoy  as well. It doesn't take a lot of time to visit and the entrance is free. Whising I've been very helpful to you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]   TELEPHONE CHANGE OUR LIFES It's imposible Nowdays to think a life without that invention how quickly affects our life especially in business. We can't imagine a big company without a phone, that can makes business more quickly than anything else. Also, I was asking too many people in the street. Could you live without  telephone? The answer was all the same ""Imposible"". An old woman told me how important was the phone when her only son was abroad studing computers in the ""Chicago University"", she told me that every night  was expecting a call from her son, for her was the line of the hapiness. However it was one persone wich he told me, it wasn't happy at all with the phone, because he used to writte a lot, especially at Christmas  to wish all his friends a very nice Christmas but now everybody phone him losing a very old fashion. In my opinion this little ""box"" that everybody has at home can safe your life, especially if you need to ring a doctor in an emergency situation. In conclusion don't make a very long phone calls and you won't have to pay a very expensive bill. ",23.00
1098," Dear Mister Robertson Thank you very much for organising the programme of our three days visit to London. The programme looks very good, especially the river trip to Greenwich. Our English class has an additional wish concerning the programme of our trip. We have seen an advertisement for the ""London Fashion and Leisure Show"" and we would all like to go to the show. We think it is a great opportunity because it only takes place once a year and it is free for students. We would suggest to replace the shopping part on Tuesday afternoon by the visit of the show. We think we would all have another chance for shopping in London sometimes later. Please think about our suggestion and the proposed change of the programme. We are sure this is suitable to all of us. Thank you very much. Best regards  [SEP]  The home of the future The view from outside will mainly be the same. The houses will look like the houses  today. A simple and well-proofen architecture. The difference will be inside the buildings. The doors would be the entrance to another world.... The fridge, the television, the stove and the Hi-Fi equipment will be attached to a computer network. Every electronic gadget in the futur home will be able to comunicate with other machines or computers. It will be possible to connect to the Internet from nearly everywhere in the house or flat. I'm sure all the things which are based on electronic parts will totally change. Also the aspects of security within people's homes. But I think there will not be many changes concerning the furnishing of the future homes. All the big and small things which are defining people's personal environment will be left nearly unchanged - the furniture, the pictures on the wall.... I suppose our future homes will be a mix of new technologies and good old tradition. It has always been like that. ",32.00
90," Mr Manager: A few days ago I went to London to have a nice holiday. I was expecting to have fun, so I decided to go to the play ""Over the Rainbow"", thats now presenting in your theatre. I read the advertisement and I thought it was going to be a plesent evening. From the beggining it was all a disappointment. When I went to buy the ticket I tried to get a discount with my student card, but that was not posible. I let this pass and I bought it anyway, thinking that  was posible that it was only a mistake in your advertisement. But the play started fourty-five minutes late, and the star of the show, of whom I'm a great fan an who was the mainly reason of why I decided to see the play, was changed for another actor, how turned out to be really bad. You will understand how upseting all this was, and I decided to visit your restaurant, thinking that could save my visit to the theatre, but it was closed and I had to go back to my hotel felling mad an hungry. I think you realized why I'm writting this letter to ask you to give  my money back. All the thing that were promised in your advertisement were not true, and it was definitly NOT the perfect evening out. Specting that you will solve this misunderstanding.  [SEP]  There's no doubt that modern tecnology has changed our lives, but how? I think that some of the changes had been very good, like the impruvement to the medical science, that now can saved millions of persons that one hundred years ago were doomed to die or to live miserable lives. It has changed the ways in how people comunicate. First the telegraph and the radio an now TV, the telephone and the Internet allowed people be in contact with others really quickly and distances arent now so difficult of overcome. But tecnology had not only changed our lives in a good way, giving us thing that can make our lives more confortable, it had also  thing that arent bad, but if they are in the hands of the wrong people they can destroy the world. The weapons and the factories are destroing our planet and we need to realized that we have to use tecnology to impruve our lives, but always triying to respect nature. ",26.0
357," Dear director of the Circle Theater! Last week I was in London. On Friday we, my friend and I visited your Theater to see 'Over the rainbow'. It should has been my best evening that week, unfortunatly it wasn't. The first thing that happen was that the show didn't start on time. Instead of 730 am as your advertisment said, it started  815 am. In the meantime we tried to get our money back to do something else, but that was impossible. When the show started Danny Brook was not acting, witch was a great dissapointment for us both. We are both big faan of him When the show was finished we went to the resturant to have something to eat. But then it was cloesed because of reparations. Due to all this troubel I think we should have our money back. We both have £15 tickets. And to an other time, make soure that your advertisment is correkt! Yours Mrs Anna Schulsson  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. She was my best friend for several years as a child. But I haven't seen her since we were 10 years old. When were nine years old and were in thired grade we had a 'House' where we used to play all afternones. In fact it wasn't a realy house, it was some stones between the trees in the littel forest neear our house. But we used to call it 'Our House'. It was a secret place and we had promissed each other not to tell anybody about it. Useally we were cooking flower-soup, and talking secrets. One day when I were there alone, I heard some other kids aproting, I sat down behind one of the stones so they shoulden't see me. One minute later, Pat and half our classe stod in 'the House' looking and laufing at me and my flower soup. Maby she did it to get friends. But in fact that day she had loosed my friendship. ",23.0
527," Dear Sir or Madam, Last month I went to the theatre with my husband to see OVER THE RAINBOW. I'm sorry, but I had a very unpleasant evening. First of all, the play started 45 minutes later. I felt so angry about that. And discounts were not available (nobody explained the reason ). Secondly, the actor wasn't Danny Brook. I wanted to see him! He is a good actor but I saw a very bad one. And we couldn't visit the theatre restaurant because it was closed. Such a bad night! I'm sure you will complain the reasons why I want my money back. If you couldn't do that, we will accept  to go to another play. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. And Lorca knew it. But Pat was in the wrong place in the incorrect hour. That's a story of a crime of passion. Let me explain it. In 1874 Lorca was the most beautiful white girl in her city (a small town near Savannah). Her family was very rich and a lot of men wanted to marry to her. But she was in love with a black man, called Jim. And Pat, the maid, saw them in the river. She couldn't keep the secret and told everything to another maid. In  few hours everyone knew it. Pour lovers! When Jim's wife knew it she caught a gun and killed her husband. Then, she cried and cried holding him. (If she hadn't do it, Lorca's father would had made the same). It was a shock for Lorca. She jumped into the river and killed herself two days after. Pat and Jim's wife lived with the guilty all their long lives. How could they forget it? ",33.0
451," Dear Sir, I am writing to explain to you what the problems were at the musical show ""Over the rainbow"" at your theatre. On your announcement foil I read that the actor was Danny Brook, but in the show there was a different actor: this is the first disappointing thing. The second problem was that the show should have started at 19:30; but it did not; it started at 20:15! On the announcement foil I read that we could have had some discounts, but it was not true. This is a very disappointing thing! Then your theatre restaurant after the show was closed because the staff were not there; so we could not visit it. I expected you to prepare ""our perfect evening out"" for us; but you did not for unknown reasons. So, now I ask you to send my money back, because I really did not enjoy that night. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Kim, her friend, used to go camping at Sunset Village every year, and that year Kim, asked Pat to come with her. She accepted. In the evening Pat and Kim used to walk along the beach and they used to stop and turn at the Main Rock, a very big rock. But one night, with the moon light, they felt encouraged to continue their walk. Pat was a little bit afraid, but Kim convinced her to follow her saying that she knew the street. But, when they heard a scream, they stopped and, when they saw a shadow coming forward them, they started running, hearing a voice saying: ""Our secret!"" When they returned to Caan, their town, they promised to keep silence about that. But Pat, coming back hom, told her mother everything. That night Kim heard another scream and the day after she ran to Pat to tell her what she heard. But Kim, and no one else found Pat. ",29.0
368," Dear sir or Madam, I have recently had a week's holiday in London and, during my stay, I went to see the musical show 'Over the rainbow', which was shown at your theatre. At first, the advertisement said that there were discounts availables, but when I went to buy the tickets there were not any discounts. As if this was not enough, the show, instead of starting at half past seven as the advertisement said, started at a quarter past eight and one of the main actors, who was supposed to be Danny Brook, was someone else. On top of everyting, the restaurant which was announced in the advertisement was closed because it was being arranged. You can imagine how dissappointed I felt after that evening, and I am writing to ask you for a further return of part of the money. I am looking forward to hearing from you soon. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  I think modern technology hasn't changed my life a lot, but it has in some things: I work with music and with graphic design too, and computers help me a lot in this things. In music, before  having a computer I could only write my compositions and 'listen' to them into my mind, because, of course, I haven't got an orchestra to play them, but now I just can record one part, and then another part, and then another one.. and I can get the sound of every instrument controlling it with a keyboard, or even create new sounds. In graphic design, before  having a computer I just could draw, but now I can create pictures pixel by pixel, develop ideas more easily, or take photographs into my computer and transform them or mix them. But, in other things, I think modern technology hasn't changed my way of living too much: I do more or less the same as I did some years ago: I get up in the morning, go to school, have lunch, study and go out with my friends without being afected by microchips or nuclear energy.

1230," Dear Marie, I am writting in connection with your letter bout the international student conference. I appreciate if I can offer you my help. I would like to give you  necessary details, which can help you to organise the conference. Richard Brown booked the Palace Hotel for the students, which is a very comfortable and close to our college. You need only  5 minutes by walking to catch the college. After  conference we are planning to organise a big party with  barbecue. The party will take place on  forest close to  camping place. I hope we will have a nice weather. Therefore, I suggest to wear some casual clothes. On the last day  an afternoon if you have some free time I would recommend you to visit a very famous exposition of Leonardo Devinci. The exposition will take place on  ""Gribaldi museum"", which you can find on the Crariden street N 5. You will never regred about my suggestion. If you need more information let me knowe. Best regards,  [SEP]  Report on the building at the Berkeley Square. In order to prepare this report I visited the business college and interviewed some students, I asked them only one question ""Which building do you find more beautiful and more interesting in our city?"" The Students, who were questioned said that there are a lot of interesting buildings in our City. However the majority of people point out one a very old building, which you can find at Barkeley Square. Most of the Students found this building very particular, because it reflects our history, tradition and culture. If you visit the building, you will get  impression,  feeling, that you are in  past times. This building attracts a lot of people, - because it has a very particular style with majestic, antique windows. In addition, I also visited this place - and I was very impressed. Finally I would recommend you visited  Barkely Square area. In this area you could also find another different buildings, which would you attract. report on the group leader from 12.06.01 ",24.00

My second chose is painting because I love water colour painting and I am a member of the our water colour painting club in my town.

They give us lots of chose to buy what we need it and what we can try for. Also they give lots of sale for everything even you can join their club for extra discount. It look wonderful does not it. But when we thing   properly shopping is not enjoyable for example if you forget something that  need for  salat. You have to go back  this supermarket and find  nearest parking space then before someone takes the their last fresh lemon for your salat you must find  where was the lemon section before because they love change the store  again and again. When you get your lemon you have to go to queue to lemons money. At it shows shopping is become  our dislikes, because of the huge supermarkets. ",23.0

First of all I came to see a play just becaus my faivourite actrice shoud of been part in it, but she didn't. The evening time on a tiket was 19.30 and actually it started at 20.15 which made visitors stay in a plase for 45 min,  waist of time. The tickets discounts was not available under any subconstanses and the theatre restaurant was closed. I strongly do recomand your to pay  minimum 50% of the full price for what I've payed. Your faithfull Mr. Farydone.  [SEP]  Fashion of the Future. I think that in 100 years from now, the clothes fashion will be totaly different. In my apineon the world by it self will be different in temperature cased by global warming as well as people  become more niceer, less   will take place, so the clothes will mainly be maid from cotton with smooth colours like dark grean or gray. It will be comfotable close becaus the main point for any caind of clothe is to be comfatable. Also there will be no leather or fethers used in maiking  clothes becaus by that time the population of animals will foll and Green pease will  very strong community, much stronger and  pouful than it is now. So as we can think the Future Fashion can be pleasent or unpleasent for different people. The stile will be more or less simelar to each other and everyon will be setisfaid with its needs. writen by H. Farydone ",14.0
304," Dear sir or madam, My name is Molly Menbrook. I have seen your new musical, 'Over the rainbow'. I am sorry but I must admit it was a bit disappointing. I bought the ticket for the evening performance to end the day with a nice musical. But the time wasn't kept. I had to wait 45mins to get in! So in order to keep myself occupied for a while, I went to the restaurant except it wasn't open. I couldn't see anyone inside either. No one. The show it self was quite disappointing. The show was OK though I suggest you hire different actors. I think Danny Brook doesn't suit the role he plays in this musical... Also you mentioned a discount. For tickets. Well no, I didn't get a discount! And the tickets were pretty expensive... Anyway, after watching the musical, I felt a bit peckish so I went to the restaurant again with  hope that it might be open, but still, nobody was in. Then a person appeared, walking towards the door to the kitchen, I guessed. I asked him why the restaurant was closed. He said it was because the runner of the restaurant had gone out to arrange the food supply for the next day. They had been closed for 3 days according to him. So you see my point. It wasn't very pleasant. So I am going to ask for a refund... I hope this isn't affending you too much... Or asking you for too much. Reply as soon as possible, best regards,  [SEP]  I think the clothes in future will be similar in shape as the clothes that exist now. Just like sweaters, shoes, t-shirts etc... But maybe not. When it comes down to color, I think it'll be much brighter and maybe glittery. Like shiny and plastic kind. Maybe silver and gold, glittery red, purple and blue. As well as bright yellow, orange and green. All suitable for discos! Shoes will be high heeled and modern. Colors to match the clothes. Still, comfortable. I think they'll be based on some kind of space theme and aliens. But I think I prefer the clothes now. I'll stick to baggy t-shirts, jeans, baseball caps and trainers. They'll do for me instead of all the silvers and golds. Al the spacy theme. I think I'll be fine in the clothes we have now... I mean, I won't get sick in them! Though some people may fancy the glitter and the spacy feel, I don't like it and I hope it really isn't the style for the future. It's just not my cup of tea... ",30.0
449," Santigo, June 17th, 2000 Mr. Manager of the Circle Theatre, While I was staying in London, I went to see one of your musical shows, ""Over The Rainbow"", because I had read the add on the newspaper, and I thought it would be an interesting experience. Let me tell you now how everything really was. One of the reason I went to see that particular show, was the starring actor announced in the add,  Danny Brook, but when the show actually started, with forty five minutes delay, I realized that Danny Brook was not in the play. The add also mentioned discounts, but that wasn't true either. After the play, which turned out to be just as bad as I thought, I wanted to relax in the Theatre Restaurant, but it was closed, and for no reason! It is for these reasons that I expect a full refund of the ticket prize, it is my right as a paying customer to get what I have paid for. Looking forward to hearing from you.  [SEP]  We can hardly imagine life without compures, T.V. sets, microwaves, and so many other things, and yet, none of these things existed seventy years ago. I think that the life we live is easier than  our parents , thanks to technology. We can do things our grandparents could only dream of.  Internet, I think, is one of the most important inventions in the history of humanity. My life has not been affected or changed by technology, because when I was born, most of the things that I use in my daily life already existed. But technology is becoming more and more complicated, and new things are invented every day, so I think that our life will be completely different in forty years. And, since all these new things only make our life easier, technology is welcome. ",32.0

Last Saturday I went to see ""Over the Rainbow"". When I read the advertisement, I noticed that Danny Brook acted in this musical show. I appreciated him a lot. When the show started forty-five minutes later, I realised that the main actor had been changed. That change really disappointed me. Another problem was that I didn't have any discount, and I wasn't alone, we were five persons. Our idea after the show, was to visit the theatre restaurant, but it was closed. Nobody could give me an answer. I really had an awful evening. Please send me a letter, with the explanations for all these problems that I told you .

We went upstairs with only a candle, and the idea of planning something crazy. Manuel had a farm, no so long from the town, where we could do whatever we wanted. But what was the problem. We were too young to stay a hole weekend alone. I thought of the idea of telling our parents that we had  a camping with the school. We were all agree. We were going to spend a weekend alone, with nobody else, playing football, going to bed at the time we wanted, talking about girls. It was perfect. We were very calm, discussing the last details of our weekend, when we heard a noise that came out from a room that was near us. Manuel opened the door, and there she was, Pat with Ramiro's sister hearing all our conversation. ",22.0

In front of my aunt's house, there is a house with  swimming pool, garage and garden. My aunt told me it was the famous French singer's house. One night, I heard a strange sound. I loocked outside and saw two men go into the house in front of mine. They went into the house through a window. I though it was some rubbers. I said to my friend that I wanted to go to see and he must phone to the police. I went near the house and waited to look what it would happen. After ten minutes, one man came out with a big bag and went into his car. When the other man came out, I caught him and fighted him. The first man went away, because a police car arrived.

1162," Dear Mrs Smith, Thank you very much for your letter. I would be very pleased if I can help you answering all your enquiries. The hotel which your students' group has been booked into is the Palace Hotel. It is fairly easy to get there from the conference. I would suggested you to walk along New Street, which is the one next to  river, and in 10 minutes you will see the hotel in your right hand side. The hotel is just opposite to the City Hospital. As you already possibly know, the end-of-conference party will take place at the main reception room at the same hotel. You should be there by 7 o'clock in the evening. Answering your question, you should be fine wearing casual clothes. However, if you wish to dress smarter, there is no problem at all. With reference to the last afternoon, if I were you I would visit the City Museum. There are many interesting works of art by famous painters of this country. If you have any time left you ought to go to the High Street, where you could go shopping. Please, do not hesitate to contact me at the above address if you need any further information. I look forward to meeting you at the Conference. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  INVENTIONS HAVE AFFECTED ALL OUR LIVES! The invention without no doubt, that has affected my own life by far is the car. Cars have definitely changed all our lives, and I am not refering only in a positive way, but in a negative way as well. Picture this: a big city such as London or New York with no cars on their streets. Could you imagine it? To be honest, I can't. Cars are part of our daily lives. Traffic jams make people nervous,  sometimes really upset and violent. But, anyway, people use cars. If we don't use them we suffer from them. In my case I use public transport during the week to go to work but I could hardly imagine my weekends without my beloved car. I really need it to escape from the pollution, mainly caused by cars and any other four-wheel motored vehicle. Isn't that contradictorious? To go to the countryside and being able to breath fresh, non-polluted air, I use my car, which, as far as I am concerned does not help to maintain a clean air at all. Therefore I am thinking in selling my car, which has changed my life over the last 10 years, which has given me a kind of freedom, which has gone with me to all sort of fantastic places, and change my life for a new life: whithout  car.

470," Dear Sir/Manager, During my visit to London, I had the opportunity to visit the Circle Theatre and to see 'Over the Rainbow'. To my dismay the musical was nothing compared to what I had expected, as it completely contradicted to the advertisement. Firstly, despite the advertisement stating that Danny Brook was starring, another actor was starring in the actual show and his performance was literally horrible, and disappointing. Secondly the starting time of the show was far from punctual. I had gone to the show which according to the advertisement was supposed to begin at 19:30, but the show did not start until 20:15. In the advertisement, it said that discounts were available. Despite this the ticket vendors explicitly told me that there were no discounts to be offered. According to the advertisement, the audience were free to go to the theatre restaurant after the show. However by the time the show had ended the restaurant was closed. I was further humiliated by the irony of the advertisement  stating that it would be my 'perfect evening out', when it was totally the opposite. I hope you understand my disappointment. In addition, as a way of compensation, I would like to have a refund, and  justification for such a show. Yours Sincerely,  [SEP]  How has modern technology change your daily life? During these past few decades, or rather,  the 20th century, there has been a significant developement in modern technology. One of the essential developement is  the form of transportation. The invention of cars planes, trains and other similar forms of transportation have enabled us to go from one place to another with no time. This enables us to save  great deal of time and effort. Quite recently, in my country electrical bicycles have been invented. This compared to the traditional bicycle is less physically painstaking and less time consuming and therefore lets me travel to my destination in  small amount of time with hardly no effort at all. This has made my life easier. On the other hand, I feel as though I am becoming lazier and exercising less. Another significant technological developement is the creation of electrical appliances. There are many indispensable electrical appliances such as television, radio, fax machines, and microwaves. What changed my life most is portal computers. They are particularly useful for someone like me who travels often. Before I used computers generally, It took so much time for me to looking up words in a dictionary and looking up for information. With a computer however, all this is done in the matter of seconds. This again enables people to save time. The modern technology helps people in many ways and is indespensible. However if we rely on it too much, we could become lazy and apathetic and as a result, would not be able to live without them once they are gone. ",32.0
196," Dear Manager, Last week, during my holiday in London, I had the opportunity to see the show ""Over the Rainbow"" at the Circle Theathre. That is why I am writing this letter; to inform you about the problems I had. First of all, the tickets were too expensive. I was told that there were some discounts to students, but at the moment I bought the ticket, they charged me a full price. The day of the show, we got to the theather at 19:30. Instead, due to some technical problems, it began at 20:15. Second, I was really disappointed when I found out that Danny Brook, the best actor I have never known and the reason for which I decided to see the show, was not going to be performing. Third, the theatre restaurant was closed because the cheff did not show up. I was really looking forward to eating at that place. In conclusion, I would appreciate  if you could, please, send me my money back because I did not have the perfect evening that I expected. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat was not very good at keeping secrets. Sally, her best friend, had told her what had been happening at her house for the last two months. Pat knew something was wrong because she had known Sally since they were five years old, but she did not  why she was acting so strange. Sally did not want to tell anybody about her problem, but she knew she could trust Pat. So Sally started to talk. She had seen her stepfather hitting her mother everytime he was drunk. She didn't want to tell the teachers at school or any other person because she was afraid that if her stepfather find out about that, he would get made and hit her, or even worse, kill her mother. However, she needed to tell somebody. One morning somebody knocked at the door at Sally's house. It was the police. Sally was so scared, and at the same time mad at Pat because she knew the only person who could have told the police was her best friend. But she knew that Pat did it because she loved her and was afraid something horrible could have happened to her or to her mother. ",33.0
391," Dear Sir/Madam! I'm a student from St. Petersburg, and I'm studing in a theatre acodimy. My freind & came to London for an excursion. We were lucky to get tickets to the ,,Over the rainbow"" show in your theatre. Danny Brook is my favorit actor & to see him was my dream from my childhood! It was a suprise when we were told there will be another actor. Also we expected to get a discounts as a students, but international students cards are not available in your theater (that is very strange - even your advertisment has an information about discounts). Another problem - we were very hungry that evening because the show was postpone  45 minutes! so we were late to our supper in the hotel and  theatre restaurant was also closed without any risons . In the advertisment it was written ,,your perfect evening out!"" , but it wasn't. And I think, I prooved you this. I'm waiting for your anser and hope I can get my money back!  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed (your) my daily life? Our days I would call a days of great technologycal progress. You can find changes everywhere. Industrial weel going faster and faster.

754," Dear Mrs. Ryan: Having won the trip to California delights me and I am providing you  the further informations you asked for: I only have two months of vacation that are July and August and since I must visit my grandparents in August, the only time possible is July. I would prefer a tent rather than a log cabin because I have been told that the Californiai summer is hot and dry so because a tent's wind circulation is better, it would create a confortable coolness. The two activities I would like to do are basketball and surfing. I have played basketball during 5 years in an amateur franchise and still play on a playground regularly so my skills are good. On the other hand, I am a complete debutant concerning surfing. This sport has always attracted me due to its contact with the sea and the great sensations it provides and I believe this is the perfect occasion to initiate myself to the exciting sport, I still have some questions to ask you: Do I need to bring  particular clothing like a surfing suit, for instance? Is any ""pocket money"" required in case there is something I need to pay for? And finally, is somebody going to fetch me at the airport or am I supposed to get to the camp on my own and get refunded afterwards? Best Regards Chi Chen  [SEP]  Shopping seems to be a true pleasure at first: spending money for yourself or people you appreciate is very satisfying and enjoyable, but it can also be a real nightmare. You often enter a shop and see people everywhere so you have to squeeze yourself through the alleys to take a look at a product. After long hours of hesitation, you decide to buy a product but discover that it is out of price. Frustrated, you nevertheless pick something cheaper and advance towards the cashiers. There, you find an enormous queue waiting for you but you still have to stay up even though your tired legs demand a seat. It is finally your turn and you reluctantly hand the money over to the hypocrital cashier. Then, you can rest a little and examine the product a little closer but unluckily, it does not provide the satisfaction you may have wished for. Instead, you keep thinking about the initial product you could not afford, resulting into more frustration and tiredness. So there are several plausible reasons why shopping is not always enjoyable.

350," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to complain about your advertisement which inform me wrong information. While I had a holiday in London I went to your theatre to see ""Over The Rainbow"", but I had a very disappointing evening. Firstly, I am a fan of Danny Brook so your advert attracted me but when I went there a different actor was in the musical show instead of him. I was so disappointed. Secondly, your timetable was wrong. It said the show started at 14.30 but, actually, it started at 20.15 so we had to wait for about six hours. Thirdly, I saw ""Discount Available"" on your advert but your staffs said it was just for Mondays. Your advert made me misunderstood. Finally, we visited your theatre restaurant after the show. However, it  closed because it was being decorated. Your advert promised me  ""Perfect evening out"", but it was  terrible evening to me. So I want you to give me a refund. Looking forward to hearing from you soon Yours faithfully, Ko Hyu Tung  [SEP]  How has mordern technology changed my daily life? When I was young, I used to play sports such as football, basketball and tennis with my friends but, these days, I am getting used to sitting in front of the computer and watching TV. When I bought my computer, I wasn't interested in it but when I started studying about  internet and playing games, I found it interesting. Sometimes, I think I am a computer addict because whenever I come back home, my hand go to  computer swich, automaticaly, even though I don't want to use the computer. I usually spend my time on playing computer  about three hours a day. After that, I go to the sofa for watch TV. Although there aren't programmes which are interesting, I just watch TV, so my mother calls me ""Couch Potato"". As a result, my health is getting worse. I know I need to excercise but it is difficult for me to start. Modern technology has changed my daily life from physical activity to mental activity (??) ",27.0
479," Dear sir, I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with the musical show which the Circle Threatre has presented. I recently had a week's holiday in London and during my stay I came to your threatre to see the ""Over the Rainbow"". My evening was very disappointing. In the advertisment, I had read that Danny Brook was starring but she was not. A different actor was playing durring the musical and he was very disappointing. The play should start at 19.30 but it started forty-five minutes later, we were waitting over there with out doing anything. We got very bored and tired. After the show had finished I went to the theatre restaurand to hav something to drink and get relaxed but it was closed because the stuff was on holiday. Moreover the discounts were not available as you say in the advertisment and I paid £20. I would like some refand because It was one of the worst evenings in my life it if this matter does not solve  I will go  further. I hope that it will be solved properly Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat was not very good at keeping secrets. He and his friends got in trouble because of this habit, last week. As they were watching T.V at Nick's house last Sunday, Sally noticed that their cut Curly was hurt,  she could not walk. The children were very unhappy and  sorry about the pet. ""Somebody had hurt her and had let her without help"" Mourk said angrily. ""We have to find him and make him pay for his action"" Sally told them. Everybod agreed with her. Suddenly Pat cried: ""Oh my Lord, Bad Jon had done this. Yesterday as I was arriving home I saw him in your yard Mack, he looked very satisfied, Curly was laying on the grass and..."" ""Yes, Oh Lord he did it because we won his team at football"" Nick said. ""He is so bad. We will make him pay. Hey Listen guys we will take his dog which  love very much and we will sell it to Sally who wants one. We will pay Curly's doctor with these money that we will earn"" Pat said. Next morning as Pat was going to school  met Bad Jon. and told  him ""Hey, you. We know what you have done and your dog will be sold"". Bad Jon understood and talked immediately to his father. who was the school minister about the children' plan. Of course they were punished. ",24.0
636," Dear Sir/Madam: Thank you for telling me that I have won the first prize and now I am writing to tell you the information you have requested. First of all, I think I would like to travel in July, which will be the only month for me to go. Because my course won't finish until the end of June, and I will have to stay in the college to get ready for the new term. Then I'd like to choose the tents for my accommodation when at Camp California. I think sleeping in a tent is funnier than others . However, during my stay at Camp, there are two activities I can choose,  one of them I will choose Basketball because it is the sport I play most, I and my friend used to win the first place in  school-wide match when we was in school. And  the other one, I think painting will be a good idea; Painting is one of my hobbies and I've been learning it since I was 5 years old and now I'm still doing it once I have  free time. Above are all the information you asked , however, here are something I'd like to know;  first is about the clothes, what kind of clothes  I need to take with ? And another question is what is the prices of things like in there,  so that I can make a better buget of my trip. Look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Kim: Thanks for your last letter; I knew you would  interested at my experience of helping  the pop concert last time, now I tell you about it. The place  we worked was a football pitch; we spent 3 days on setting up the stage, the equitment, and the lights. In fact, there is nothing very important I did, because we are not the right people to do it. I only put the speakers in the right places, or helping  engieners tested the lights. But at the brakes and after work, I had a chance to talk with the engieners, and I leant something about setting up the equitment. The fourth day, the singers and the players have been to there to test. Then I had a chance to speak with them. From that, I learnt more about  instruments. Finally, the date of  concer came. After the concer finished successfully, I was happier than ever because the succeed inclueded my work and that was the most enjoyable moment in my life. Anyway, now I have to stop to finish my homework. I'm looking forward to receiving your letter again. Best wishes. ",24.0
846," 13rd of June Dear Helen Ryan, I was really happy when your letter arrived and I node that I won the first prize in your competition. I have never been in the U.S.A. Now I will give you the informations which you asked for. For me it is only possible to travel in July. That is the only month where I have time because after July I have to start with the University. I would prefer to sleep in a tent because I am used to it. When I was a child my parents and I spent a lot of time at camps. You wrote that I should choose two activities. I have chosen golf because I playing golf sine 1998 and I want to improve it and then I decided to start a new kind of sport and I would like to start with climbing. I could play in the first week golf and in the second I could start with climbing. What about money and clothes? You know what kind of clothes I need and could you give some advices  how much money I will need? Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable I think it depents if you are a man or a woman and now I have to say I am a woman and I enjoy it. Honestly I had never a shopping tour which I didn't enjoy when I was alone. I can remember one shopping tour which I had  with a man and it was  nightmare. It was a fantastic sunny day and we went to Frankfurt and I really needed shows and it is not easy to buy shoes you have to choose carefully. I tried ten pairs of shoes and with every shoe his mood got worse and worse and at the end we had a big fight about everything. We left the shop without  shoes, in  horrible mood and we went home. Now he is my ex.boyfriend! Two days later I went back to the shop and I bought the shoes which I still wear. This was for me the only shopping tour which was not enjoyable. To sum up, my advise is that the women should go alone or with a female friend. ",26.0
1022,"  Dear Mr Robertson, First of all I would like to thank you  the chance to do such a gorgeous trip. We are really looking forward to visiting the city and going to the Museum and  Gallery. However, there is one point that we would like to change in the programme. We are interested in visiting ""The London Fashion and Leisure Show"" during our travel. The show is very interesting because we could see the latest fashion, hairstyles and make up, and also  leisure and sports wear. Furthermore  is totally free for students. All this exhibiots are really important and exciting for us because, nowadays, fashion has a huge influence in our lifestyle and we would like to know more about it. We think that we could go there   next 14th of March, in the eveninng, instead of going shopping. This one could be translate to  15th  evening. It is also possible to go to the show in the morning but we are totally agree that we don't want to lose our visit to the Science Museum. We truly believe you will consider our change. Please contact us if you have any question. Yours faithfully  [SEP]   Almost everyone relation famous people with photographers, articles, money, fans, ... Normally, one people's dream is to be famous and rich but without that stuff of being without privacy Nowadays, there is a lot of people that life only with the money they get in advertisments, reports about their last romance, ... but not everyone does the same . On the one hand you find the ones that are well-known and never talk about their privacy. They use the publicity exclusive for their work. On the other hand,  are the ones that are also respectabled but, appart from their relation with journalists because of their work, they really need to be constantly seek by photographers. I mean, they enjoin being the point of view or the center of everyone, even though it means to see their lifes. Communications move the world and famous people use them to improve their work, politicians for their campain and film stars to make famous their last movie. Nevertheless, sometimes communications disturb their lifes in a wrong way. ",29.00
40," Dear: Jane Clark I had been  your annual international art festival. Most of the events I went to were good, but I feel that the festival could be even better next year. So, I write some of my opionions and suggestions to you. I hope it's may help for next year's festival. The idea of  ""International Art Festival"" was great. But I feel the word of ""International"" was not really suit; because you just only got six countrie's stars and artists came. I think you should invite more than ten countries. The other problem was choosing space. Like the hall of  classical concert was too small and crowded. Next year, you should calulate or examine how many people come before you choose a hall, which I feel very good was plays and films. It can show more for next year's festival. The Dance Shows as well. And the offer of  ""weedend ticket"" was an excellent idea. Because the price was cheaper than buy it sperate and more convience. Look forward for next year's festival. Yours Sinicerely,  [SEP]  One day, a little girls called Sara. She was walking over a bridge. Suddenly, she heart a men voice called her ""Sara...Sara.. look down to the river.""

She never seen any fish  had that wonderful colour and can talk with her. Because Sara hasn't got any bother and sister, and her Mon and Dad need work everyday, so she was very lonely. Therefore, she came  river everyday and talk  everything to the golden fish. They were very close friend. After half  year,  golden fish suddenly disappear. Sara was very sad.

[SEP]  As our class is going to mark a short video about daily life at college, I write this report to suggest some lessons and activities which should be filmed. 1. English lesson. Because all students in  English class are from all over the world. We can talk  everybody's feeling  living and study at a foreign country. 2. Computing lesson and computer room. Nowdays  internet makes us closer and closer. We can get all what we want on  internet. It's one of the most important things in our life now. 3. Liabrary. We not only borrow books from  liabrary but also study at  liabrary. Library is very important in our daily life. 4. Canteen. Everyday we go to  canteen have lunch, no matter  you bought food from there or you take your own food. 5. Football. What do you do after class? Joging or doing some sports? You can't forget football. These are what I think should be filmed. If any of you have other suggestion, we can discuss  again. But I think these five lesson or activities are  most common in our daily life at college. ",24.0

508," Dear Sir I write a letter to complain about your advertisement about the musical show ""over the rainbow"", wich is misleading in a number of way. Firstly we arrived at 19.15 to be in time for the show, which should have started at 19.30. However it started at 20.15 and we were all very disappointed. Furthermore, it's written in your advert that Danny Brook is in the play and that was one of the main reason to why we went. Imagine how disappointed we got when we found out that he had been replaced. Besides, when we wanted to buy our tickets we were hoping that the discounting was available. Unfortunately, it wasn't and we couldn't afford bying everyone a ticket. Finally, after the show we had planed to eat diner at the theatre restaurant and we were very disappointed when it turned out to  closed. Therefor, as you may understand I'm asking for a refund. These kinds of misadventures can easily ruin your reputation.

I was unable to image what would happen to me if my parents knew what I had stolen. 'You may enter' said the director. Tairs ran down my face as I admitted having stolen. I was suprised that my father didn't watch me but I soon understood that he was ignoring me. Mother, on the other hand, looked at me and seemed both disappointed and betrayed.

First the actor was changed and his  performance was very poor and disappointing. Then, the show began 45 minutes later, so we had to wait  very long . The advertisement said there were discounts available, which were not . At the end you said it will be a Restaurant, but it was closed, so we couldn't eat anything untill we got home.

For example, I was born knowing the man has stepped on the moon. There are some machines which have helped in my development, and others which help me to make my life easier. The computer for example makes communication much easier and faster then in past time, when everything was send by common mail, and it took weeks till it got  the right place. There are other machines which are bad for the environment. Many industries throw their contaminated air away, without cleaning it before. Technology has to move further so it can solve problems  as pollution, so we can live better and longer. ",22.0

Thirdly, I prefer staying in a tent than staying in a log cabin. I think it is more fun. Concerning the activities, I would choose tennis and sailing. I am very good at tennis. Last year, I took part in a competition and I did it well. I have also a licence for sailing but I have not done it for a long time. I need to know what kind of clothes I should take with me.

Yours sincerely, Sofia Jordana  [SEP]  It is Saturday. The car park of the supermarket is full. No more trolleys for shopping. All the shops are crowded. Some people are in a hurry other are agressive and most of the other are very stressed. It is not always like that but we often see such a scene, even though shopping is becoming an entertainement not only for teenagers but also for adults. We have more and more shops everywhere and they sale everything. Because of that, people's need has increase a lot nowadays. It is also the reason why we have all these new supermarkets. In the one hand, it is very enjoyable to go shopping because we can find a lot of things. Sometimes we need them and sometimes we don't but it is fun to buy new clothes, furniture and so one. In the other hand, the  service in the shops or supermarkets has decrease a lot those last  years. The shop assistants are not always nice and sometimes they don't even know a bit about what they sell. In my opinion, shopping is not always enjoyable especially when there is too many people in there. ",33.0

All my disappointment started when we noticed that there were no discounts available for the tickets, but as we wanted to see Danny Brook's performance, we decided to buy them anyway. We got really upset when we realized he was being substituted. The show was scheduled for 19:30 but it only started at 20:15. Besides the boredom of having waited for forty-five minutes, we were not allowed to visit the restaurant after the show, since it was already closed by the time the show finished.

The crimes she describes seem so perfect that we brainstorm a lot trying to find out who is the criminal. I thought about you while reading the book because I remembered you have booked a place in a Detective course. I'm sure you'll find this book an interesting object of study. Agatha Christies stories are simple, but very well written, and, as I told you, very coherent. It's estimulating to read them. One of the stories will be read on the radio next week. I'm sure that if you listen to it you will start reading the book immediately, and find out there  many challenges for your new carreer. I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon.

DURING, THE LAST MONTH I'VE BEEN READING ""A WINDOW ON THE UNIVERSE"" AN OXFORD BOOKMARKS COLLECTION BOOK. THIS BOOK CONTAINED NINE STORIES WHICH WAS WRITTEN BY WELL KNOWNS WRITTERS LIKE RAY BRADBURY. BUT THE MAIN PURPOUSE OF THE BOOK IS ALLOW YOU TO FLY WITH YOUR IMAGINATION AND HAVE A LOOKING OF HOW A LIFE  GOING TO BE IN THE FUTURE, WHEN, PERHAPS THE WORLD WILL BE COMMANDED BY MACHINES. I THINK THAT THIS IS A MARVELLOUS BOOK TO READ, BECAUSE YOU ARE ABLE TO PUT YOUR MIND UP AGAINST THEMES LIKE ""HUMAN RACE EXTINTION"" AND ALSO OBTAIN A COMPARISON BETWEEN  HUMAN-MIND AND COMPUTERS. SO, IF YOU ARE LOOKING THROUGH A ""REALLY SPLENDID SCIENT FICTION BOOK"" I WILL RECOMMEND YOU TO READ ""A WINDOW.."" AND I'M SURE THAT WHEN YOU FINISH READING IT YOU WANNA READ IT AGAIN, AND AGAIN...! ",31.0
428," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to complain about the musical show advertised in your latest leaflet. First of all, I would like to say that it was the worst performance I had ever seen and it disappointed me very much. Although your advertisement stated that the main actor would be Danny Brook, it was not him and a different man  was not prepared for the role. Secondly, you advertisement stated that the second show should start at 19:30. It was not true because the audience had to wait until 20:15. Then, I did not get a discount and I had to buy a full-price ticket, although I am not  adult yet. Finally, I was hungry after waiting for the show and wanted to order something to eat. It was, however, impossible because the theatre restaurant was closed for unknown reasons. I would like you then to send the money back to me because I did not enjoy the show at all and the ticket costed a fortune. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. She heard from her friend Jon that Paul, the worst pupil at school, had thrown an enormous frog inside the desk of Miss Colston, their English teacher. Miss Colston was an old woman, who wanted her pupils to understand and admire English novels and poems. But the children were bored during her lessons and Paul was very disappointed that she didn't read any funny stories. So he decided to scare the old woman away from school. Now he thought it was stupid to tell Jon about it, as he was the best friend of Pat. ""Oh, that girl will cause some problems"" - he thought when Miss Colston entered the classroom. She approached the desk and wanted to open it, but suddenly Pat shouted - ""Miss Colston, please, don't do that. There's a frog"". The teacher stared at the whole class and calmly whispered - ""Who did it?"" ""Oh, God"" - thought Paul - ""the next time I will throw a frog inside Pat's rucksack."" ",40.0
1242," Neuchâtel, 12th June 2001 Dear Mrs Smith, I thank you for your recent letter. First, I would like to congratulate  on your new responsability,  because of Mr Brown's illness. I give you with great pleasure all the details needed. Your group is staying at the Palace Hotel, which is located directly in front of the bus station. To go to the conference from your hotel is really easy. You have to take the bus number 1 and get off at ""Black House"", which is the third stop. After the conference, at about 8 pm. a party is organised. During it, everybody will have the opportunity to met and talk to the speakers of the conference. Food and beverages will be available. After the cocktail, the Band ""Zero one"" is playing their famous songs. The clothes, required for the party are suits for men and cocktail dresses for women. Before your departure, you will have time to visit the Olympic Museum or to make a sightseeing tour in our city. I hope you will enjoy your journey in our city and look forward to meeting you at this conference. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Report on the ""Paintings Museum"" In order to write this report, I spent hours in this wonderful museum. There, I saw the exibitions and admired the building itself. I walked around the garden too. Location The museum is located in Ouchy, in front of the ""Delamuraz Hotel"". It is close to the main road, and at 300 meters of the station. Outside The building is made of white stones. It has two floors. Before going inside, you have to pas through the huge garden. There, ponds, pools, trees, flowers and ducks can be admired. I recommend you to take your swim suit, because in summer, it is allowed to swim in  pools. Inside When you are inside the museum, you will be impressed by the paintings on the walls. There were all painting during the war by nurses. If you go down a few steps, you will discover the ceilar. Everything in this room is about wine. To learn the whole history of the building, there is a room dedicated to it on the first floor. I particularly recommend you to visit the ""blue"" room. Everything in this room is blue, the carpet, the ceiling and even the door. According to the owner, it was a room where in the past people used to go when they were depressed. Conclusion To sum up, I would like to add that this house is the most famous in our city. You should come and visit it for the paintings or for the building itself. You won't be disappointed. The only negative point is that you have to pay 10 francs to visit. the house and the garden. ",34.00
1232," Dear Madam, I received your letter and I'm pleased to answer your questions. M. Brown has booked rooms in the Palace Hotel. This is a first class hotel. The easiest way  from the hotel to the conference is with the bus. There is a bus stop in front of your hotel. Take the bus in  direction   center  town. After four stops get off the bus. The name of this bus stop is 'Kongresshaus'. If you leave the bus, the conference is in the house opposite the road. You can't miss it. Afterwards we will eat together in a restaurant and we will go in a disco. For the disco you musn't wear blue jeans. Finally at your last day I propose you to do a sightseeing tour in our town. It takes you two hours. Afterwards you will have any time to buy some souvenirs from Switzerland. If you have any more questions, write me back. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  I will write about the invention of the computer. With the computer our work is easier and more interesting. Before the time with computers, people had to write every time a whole letter . When they  would correct a word, they had to write the whole letter again. With the computer we can write a letter, correct a word or change the name without writting the whole letter again. We save the letter and in three week we could send it to another person. I work at a bank and I work all day with computers. If we hand't ay one, we had to write all the transactions on papers. If I order money for our bank with the computer I can be sure that I will arrive the day after. But if I had to write a letter and to send it by post, the money will arrive two or three days after. I have never work without a computer, but if we hadn't any we would it find normally. ",29.00
705," Dear Ms Ryan Thank you for your letter. I was so happy to hear that I have won a two weeks holiday in the U.S.A. I would like to travel in July. I am going to finish my exams in June, and I am planning to go back to China in early August. So if I could travel in July, and coming back before  6th of August, that would be great. I would prefer living in tents to log cabins. I have never had any experience  to live in a tent, so I would like to give it a go. I think I will enjoy myself in a tent. I love swimming, but I am not any good at swimming. I really wanted to learn how to swim. I was wondering if there is a coach  could give us a lesson during the Camp. Also, I would like to join  basketball team, I used to play basketball when I was in high school, and our high school basketball team have won many competitions during  last ten years in our city. I am glad I had taken a part in a few competitions, and I was so proud of our basketball team. Would you tell me that how much money you would give it to me and how is the weather like in  U.S.A. Thank you for every thing! Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Dear Kim, It was great to hear from you, haven't seen you since last summer holiday, hope everything is fine in your place. You wanted to hear about my experience at the pop concert which I enjoyed helping  last month? I must say that was a great fun, I've never had this kind of experience before. Before the concert actually started I had to give out lots of leaflets, they are list of pop band and group which will appear in the concert in order, and some information about their performance and backgrounds. After that, I had to help people who had a ticket but can't find their seat. During the concert, I didn't have a lot to do, so I had  chance to see most of the performance, that was excellent. I was excited that I had a closer look at so many famous pop stars. During  break time I did give a lots of direction to people who can't find  toilet, and  information such as where they could have a cup of coffee. That was  bit boring, but it was part of my job. I got to go. Write to you next time. Love ",34.0
490," 17/6/2000 Saturday  Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to inform you about my disappointing evening  I spent at the play ""Over The Rainbow"" presented by The Circle Theatre. The problems started at the beginning. Although it was written 19.30 in the advertisement, the play began at 20.15. In addition, a different actor was starring instead of Danny Brooks and this was the most disappointing thing that evening for me and my friends. I was told  to be able to get discounts, however, I could not get any. I also went to your theatre restaurant after the show, but it was closed because it was being redecorated. As a result, I could not have my perfect evening out. For all the reasons I have mentioned above, I would like to get at least half of my money back. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  17/6/2000 SECRETS' DAMAGE Unfortunately, Pam wasn't very good at keeping secrets, and this made her lose her friends, her job and everything she had. From the time she began the university, the problems began. She was telling  secrets of her friends to the others. One day, her friends got fed up with this and ended their friendship. Pam was sorry but there was nothing she could do about this. Then she began to work at a company. One day, she again told the secret formula or a production to a friend of hers. Unfortunately, this friend told this to some other people and when it was understood that Pam was guilty, she was fired. Life and harder than anytime for Pam then. She had no friends. Nobody wanted to talk to her either. One day, she moved to a farm and nobody has heard from her since then. ",28.0
1078," Dear Mr. Robertson, My name is Bao-yu Liao. I am  representative of our class in your college to write to you. We are very grateful for what you have well-organised the programme going to London for us. It is a good programme, especially  National Art Gallery is one of the most places we would like to visit. This is because we are very interested in art. In fact, some of our classmates have seen an advertisement for the 'London Fashion and Leisure Show'. Concidently the show is in London and on Tuesday March 14 which is during the period we are in London for the three-day programme. We think it is a great opportunity because we are very interested in art and fashion. Of course,  leisure as well. Therefore, if it is possible, we would like to see the show in the afternoon on 14 March instead of going shopping. It would be very much appreciated if you could arrange  the programme to be changed. We look forward to hearing a good news from you soon. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Famous people, such as politicians and film stars, deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time. We know it does not matter  they are famous or not, everyone has his own privacy. However, as human beings, almost all of us are curious. We like to know and chat about gossip. This is why gossip magazines are so popular. Due to commercial value, journalists have to follow them all the time to peep  their private lives to satisfy us. There, it is impossible for journalists to stop chasing them. However, journalists should not only think about commercial value, but morality and priciples are also being concerned. Of course, it everyone pays less attention or interest, the situations should be better. I remember in August 1997 Princess Diana died in the car crash was one of the most disarster examples. Although we can not deny it is our nature -  curious, we can improve our sence of morality and try to think about the importance of privacy for them. Actually, I am happy to hear that journalists have learned their lesson from the death of Princess Diana and try to let her children and  Royal family have more privacy. Lets all leave them more freedom to enjoy their private lives. ",31.00
293," Sir manager Yesterday I went to ""The Circle Theatre"" to see the musical show ""OVER THE RAINBOW"". I'm very disappointed of this evening. The first thing was, that it started 45 minutes late. And when it finaly started, there wasn't Danny Brook who plaied. There was a different actor and he was really bad. You should have informed us before that you've changed the actor. On the advertisement you wrote that discounts are available but they weren't. After the show I wanted to drink somthing in your theatre restaurant but when I arrived it was closed because the show started to late! I'm so disappointed! I wanted to have a pleasant evening while I'm here in London for a week's holiday. So I ask you sincearly for my money back becaus it wasn't a perfect evening out.  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. I told her that my parents are getting divorsed and that I will move to Chicago with my mother. We are together in High School in California and this is our last year. We wanted to study biology here in Los Angeles with some other friends but now my plans have changed and I have to leave them. One day, Pat and I were going home, when she asked me, if I will give a party befor I'll go. I had to tell her that I don't have the time to organise anything becaus we, my mother and I, have to get our stuff ready to move. She wasn't very surprised and soon I've forgotten her question. The year was getting to the end. On Monday in our last week Pat asked me if I want to eat supper at her house. I thought it was a good idea and we went home. But when we get into the hous ther were all my friends! We had a great evening becaus Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets! ",25.0
3," Dec. 16th, 2000 Dear Ms Clark, I am writing to mention my opinions on the International Arts Festival that you have organised this year. It was a great idea, but I think I need to make some points about the things that I found unsatisfactory. First of all, I was disappointed that the artists invited were from only six countries. Next year's festival will be much better if artists from places other than Europe and the USA take part in it. Secondly, despite the high quality of the concerts, some of the halls they were given in were too small for the crowd of audition. They were cold and moist, too, because the air-conditioning system was insufficient. Thirdly, I think more plays and films should be shown next year. However, I found the idea of a single ticket for all  events of the weekend excellent, as the price was reasonable and access to a wide range of events was provided. Finally, I should say that I had a very good time in spite of the flaws and I would like to thank you for it. I wish to enjoy an even better festival next year. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dec 16th, 2000 Dear Mary, I'm glad to have received your letter and I'd really like to talk about the school and family rules here. Firstly, the weirdest rule in our schools is that we must wear uniforms all the time. This is especially bad for us girls, as we are obliged to wear skirts and we cannot climb the stairs or run like the boys. But apart from this, I think most rules of the school are quite reasonable, like addressing to the teacher using the second plural person (it is different in Turkish) or standing up when s/he enters the class. As we are a developing country, teachers are quite respected. Another thing  different from your schools is that we don't change classrooms between periods. We stay in the class in which we have been registered for the whole year, and a different teacher comes in every period. Let me talk about the rules at home. We like chatting on the phone so much that most of us' parents have limited the talking time down to five minutes, threatening to cut off the wires otherwise. Also, as most of us live in flats, we're not allowed to listen to loud music or run or play ball games in the house! But we are legally allowed to play instruments like the piano until 10 p.m. I'd love to write more, Mary, but I'm in a real rush nowadays. This month has been full of exams and there are still ones coming up next week, so I must be a swot as you see. Anyway, I'm looking forward to hearing your comments about our rules. Take care!

450," To the attention of the Circle Theatre Manager: Dear Sir, I am writing to complain about your show ""Over the rainbow"" and the conditions in which it is held. I was having a week's holiday in London when I decided to go to the theatre and see a musical show. I had read your advertisement in a morning newspaper and the show seemed very attractive to me. Moreover an English friend of mine had told me that it would purely be a good show as Danny Brook was a very good actor. So on Saturday, June 7, I was there for the 7:30 pm show and here are my reasons for complaining. Firstly, there were no discounts available  as  stated in your advertisement, not even for students, and I had to pay for a full-price ticket. Secondly, we had to wait until 8:00 pm before being able to have a seat and the show finally beginned at 8:15! No need to say how much I was disappointed to see that another actor was performing instead of Danny Brook and the actor didn't seem to have rehearsed the role very much. At the end of the show, I decided to have dinner in your theatre restaurant and I went there ...just to find out that it was closed because it was being newly painted. To sum up, it was not the ""perfect evening out!"" you advertised. So I am asking you to pay me back at least half of the ticket price for the inconvenience that was caused to me. I hope that you will understand my request and reply to me in a positive way by sending me a cheque to my address in France (see the letterhead). Looking forward to receiving your reply very soon. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. That's what I learned from my own experience. We were both in the same class in high school and used to spend a lot of time together; we were actually very good friends and had no secrets for each other. At that time, I used to buy a lotery ticket once a week and I sometimes won small amounts. One day, while I was checking my weekly ticket, I found out that I had five numbers out of six so that I would surely get a substancial amount of money. I had to wait ten days before the lotery head office would give me the cheque and one week before I could learn how much I had won. But I was too excited to keep it secret so I told Pat that I had won a prize for five correct numbers and had her swear not to tell anyone. But soon everyone in the class was looking at me smillingly and I find out that I had many unsuspected friends... No longer after, they were asking me to pay a coffee or lunch for them; some proposed to go shopping, others to go to the cinema and the restaurant. Well, they all seemed to be so different and behaved in such an unusual way each time they saw me that I began to think that they knew something about me. Endly came the end of the week and I went to the lotery office to check the amount I had won. I was very disappointed to learn that I'd only won three hundred francs for many people had found five numbers like me. SO I told my friend Pat how much I had won and the following day at school, everybody were just the same as they ever were with me... ",34.0
518," Dear Sir, I would like to complain about the show which you presented on last saturday. It was such  disappointing evening out with my friend during our a week's holiday in London. We have had a quite pleasant time except  the evening. Actually it spoiled our time. So I would like to get back our money. These are some points I want mention about the differencies between  the advertisement said and the realities. First, I had a great expectation to see Danny Brook plays his role, but he had never shown up that night. The main actor was an unknown actor. It was a such disappointing. Second, it started only at 20:15. It was 45 minutes later than it suppose to be. It was a such boaring to wait  the show in a noisy and hot theatre. Third, there was no possibility of  discount. The girl  sold the tickets was laughing at me when I mention about  the discounts availability was written in the advertisement. Forth, the theatre restaurant was closed. There was a not on the door saying that the painting was going on the weekend. How could you arrange work like that? Finally the sentence  was written blow down on the advertisement was absolutely not true. It was  most imperfect evening out I ever exprienced. I wish that you can provide a better service next time, and this time you need give back the money we paid. Sincerely Yu Phu Tung.  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Since I moved to London to study English I have had a hard time to make intimate friendship with people around me. First it was because of the culture difference. It took quite  long time to adjust in the multi culture in the language institue. Secondly the language ability was another issue. Even  I could meet some friend, but I couldn't express my heat to them for we have different back ground and our first language were different. I really wished to have a friend  can share everything  is going  in our lives. Finally I met Pat. She was a such wonderful person in our class. She tried to help others when they have  difficult time at school. One day she realized that I was always been outside of  circle. One day she invited me to her flat. Since then we have visited each other often and spent time together in  weekend usally. We had a fantastic time together for three monthes. Even we could make a trip to Paris in the school holiday! We had many common interests in music, art and books. I thought that I  found a good friend in my life. So I told her everything about my life. There were some stories I never told anyone before, but I had share with her all my secrets. Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Few days later I told her about my secret love story, it became a top gossip among my classmate. It was a nightmare! ",14.0
551," Dear Helen I'm very happy for winning the first prize in the competition. I think it would be a very good experience for me. I'm realy excited about it. Fist of all I'm going to give  some informations about me. Actually, I'd prefer to travel in July, because I'm working at the moment, in a company, and I'll only have two weeks off in the period between the fifteenth and the thirtieth of July. I'd love to come earlier, but I realy can't because this job is very important for me, and I'll need it as a work experience, for my further studies in the University. I will also appreciate , if you would offer me accomodation in a log cabin, because of some health problems that I have, which are not allow me to leave outsid on the ground, and to be honest with you, I never liked camping. I'd also like to choose photography and painting from the list of activities, because I've studied Arts for three years, and these two are my favourite hobbies. I'd also like to ask you how much money I'll need for these two weeks, and what kind of clothes should I take with me, because I've never been to the States, and I don't know how the weather is  in California during the summer. I'm looking forward  hearing from you. Your sincerely  [SEP]  Shopping is an obsession for all of us. We all like going out to the shops, and spend hours, looking  all sorts of products and comparing the prices, until we decide which one is the most suitable for us. But shopping is not always enjoyable. Especially if you are going with women or children to the shops. That is my worst nightmare. I never go shopping with women and especially with my mother or my sisters. And that's because they spend hours trying on any kind of clothes, everything you can imagine, and at the end they are not buying anything. They also like going to loads of shops, in different parts of the city. At the end I feel very tired and angry, because I spent the whole morning doing nothing, except from looking at them trying  diferent clothes, and that's not enjoyable at all, in fact it's realy annoying. Also, you have to be careful when you go for shopping with children. Children always ask for something and they want to have all they toys which they see and that's not very enjoyable for the parents, because sometimes they spend more money, from the amount of money that they have planned.

253," Monday, the 5th of June 2000 To the Circle Theatre's manager Dear Mister, I recently had the opportunity to see ""over the rainbow"" which was played last week in the Circle theatre. I'm writing to you because I'm very disappointed by the bad evening I spent there. Actually, I read the advertisment for the show and there were a few mistakes on it. In fact, Danny Brook didn't play or appear on stage last Tuesday, the role was played by another - a quite bad - actor, less famous than Danny Brook. I'm also sorry because I had to wait 45 mn before the pieces started. I can't accept waiting so long for the result I had. I was in London with some friends (we were students) and no discount was proposed or made for us. We had to pay £15 each for seeing a miserable pieces. After the piece, we waned to eat at the theater restaurant but we couldn't. It was apparently closed and I'm asking you why. As you can see, there are some (volontary?) mistakes on the advertisment you made. We didn't have a ""perfect evening out"" at all. That's why I'm asking you for giving us  money back. I'm sure we'll find a compromise and I'm really looking forward to hearing from you soon. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  An unusual part of life. Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, and half a week later, all the school knew about me. I had a strange feeling then because it was just amazing to notice how money can attract so much people. I started to have a lot of new friends, they all wanted to be my best friend. Actually, my best friend would still remain Pat, even if he failed me. It's not easy to keep such an enormous secret and I couldn't keep it inside of me. I became quickly bored by this hypocrital attention they had for me. They didn't stop giving me advice or telling me what to do with my money. I always has been involved in many differents associations, which are fighting against AIDS or cancer. I knew at this moment what to do exactly and finally, I could refind my ordinary life as an unpopular student. ",35.0
610," 13. June. 00 Dear Mrs Ryan, I have been the happiest woman since I have got your letter. I could not believe my eyes. This was the first competition which I took part  and I have won the first prize. It is incredible! I would like to give you some information. First of all, I would like to travel on  19th of July and come back on  2nd of August, because I have to work until 19th of July. Secondly, I would prefer to stay at Camp California, because I have been at log cabins before and I didn't enjoy it. This time I want to try something different. I would also like to tell you about my free-time activities. I like painting and climbing. I am actually not so good at climbing, but I like the fear of risks and dangers. My painting is not bad, but many people don't like the way I paint, because I use only  pencil. I am happy`,, because I will have the chance to do this two activities. Finally, I would like to ask you if I should take a lot of clothes with me, because I do not know what's the weather like there. My last question were; how much money do I need? I hope, I have answered all  questions.  I am looking forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjeyable. If I had the possibility, I would never go shopping to the big supermarkets. You can lose your way if you do not follow the signs, or you can not find the items what you want to buy. When I was at  supermarket last week I suddenly decided not buying from a supermarket at all. First of all you need a lot of time, because the market is so big. Secondly, you have a lot of choises and you do not know which one to buy. Lastly, there is a recyling problem which many people do not care about. You buy a lot of items without thinking where should go so much rubbish. For instance, I think a lot about this issue, and sometimes I do not even want to spend water, although I should do it. I think I am too sensible. I'd prefer to go  the markets which are open and outside. So you can ask about the qualities and prices and get immediately your answers. In my opinion, small  and the markets outsides should be supported, on the other hand the big supermarkets should think more about the recyling problem, which will be the most important problem in the near future.

I recive a paper where I was told about a play you are presenting and of the advantages I would recive if I go to see it,  think that never happend. I am realy desappointed, and I want to have my money back. First of all, in the sheet I recived, it says that DANNY BROOK was one of the actor, thing that is not true, because insted of him, there was another actor, that I don't know what's his name is. Second, it says that the play would start at 19:30, and it realy started at 20:15. Third, I was told that I can have some discount, and when I was buying my ticket, the lady in the cabin told me that that discount doesn't exist. After that, when the show was finished, I was going to the theatre restaurant, and a man that works there told me that it was closed, and he don't want to give me  reasons. You can see that you promise me I'll have a good evening and I realy don't have it. So I suggest, you give me my money back, or I would go to the police, because you lie to me and you know what it means. thank you.

340," Dear Mr Redford, I'm writing to you to complain about the problems which were shown at the ""Over the Rainbow"" musical show. In the advertisement I read that Danny Brook started in the show but when I got there I realised there was a different actor in his place whose acting wasn't good enough. I have also read that the show was supposed to start at 19:30 but it didn't. It started at 20:15 leaving us writing for fourty five minutes. You have also advertised that there would be discounts available but there weren't and that we could visit the theatre restaurant after the show but it was closed because they were redecorating it. In the advertisement you write that it's the perfect evening out but all these problems made my evening in the show very unpleasant. As you are the manager of the show, you should try to avoid this sort of problems in future shows. I also ask  to return me some of my money for the unpleasant evening I passed at your show.  [SEP]  In the future people will wear clothes made of polyseer and nylon because cotton and wool will be rare and expensive. Clothes will be bright coloured and loose. I don't think anyone will wear a suit as it will be old-fashioned. Also I think clothes will have many gadgets on them like a small oxygen mask in case someone goes in a place with extended pollution - I think there will be many such places in a hundred years - and a hat designed to protect people from the strong sunrays of the sun at midday because the ozone layer will be destroyed in a hundred years and the sunrays will make damage to the human skin. Also the clothes in a hundred years will have the ability to cool down the people who wear them in the summer and the same clothes will keep them warm in cold winters' days. As you can realise I think  future's clothes will be adjusted not on only in fashion and the seasons but in the needs of every on as to protect from the earths pollution as well. ",34.0
486," 17th - June - 2000 Auda. Lolas 44 MADRID 23456 SPAIN Dear Sir, I am writing to complain about the show ""Over the rainbow"" taking part  the 15th of June The last week I have been to London for a holiday. There is saw the advertisement for this show and I decided to go there. I went to buy the tickets but when I paid there was not any discount avaible. In the advertisement you told me I would have  discounts. This was not the worst thing because when I arrived at the theatre I was waiting fourty five minutes because the show should start at 19:30 and it started at 20:15. When it started the main actor Danny Brook was not in , another worse actor was taken his part. In my opinion when the main actor can not do the show it is better not do the show than do it with a horrible actor. When it finished I arrived at the theatre restaurant but it was closed because they are going to do a new better restaurant. In my opinion you should refuse my money because the evening and the show were so terrible. Your faithfully  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. But I did not know it, and I told her my secret: I have fell in love with Paul a friend of us. No one know it else her. The wendsday Pat phoned me and told me that Sally also love Paul. I had also told Sally my secret. The thursday Sally phoned me, because we are also friends, but she did not tell me anything about Paul. The weekend started and this Friday we went to the dyscoteque. I spent there a good time but at the end , when we were going to come back home, I saw Sally kissing Paul!! It was terrible!! When Sally came out  the dyscotheque I was very nervous and I started to shout  her. She hit me and I decided in this moment that I never should speak with her . Paul ask Pat what had happened and she told him my secret. One friend of mine told me that Pat had told Paul my secret and I went to speak with her. Now we are friends but I know that I can not tell her any secret. ",23.0
1095," Dear Mr Robertson, I am writing, on behalf of an advanced class, to you to thank you for having organised our a three-day programme on 13th to 15th March. We discussed the programme. It would be great to take a trip to Greenwich by boat. We all would love to do it. However, we have seen an advertisement about ""The London Fashion and Leisure Show"" recently. It will be held at Central Exhibition Hall on 14th March at 10 a.m to 7 p.m.. According to an advertisement, a lot of events will take place during the show such as make up, hairstyles, latest fashions and leisure and sports wear. It would be a golden opportunity to know up-to-date fashion. In addition, it is free for students. After consideration, we would like you to reorganise the 2nd day programme. We are politely asking you. It would be grateful if you can reorganise this matter at your earliest convenience. I look forward to meeting you to discuss this matter. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Hide and Seek! Nowaday, a lot of celebrities, such as pop, film and sports stars, suffer from being intruded on the privacy of their lives. Undoubtedly, their the first enemies are ""Journalists"". Some people are in favour of covering famous people's in-depth stories. Because it is interesting and they can forget about their own problems by imagining celebrities' luxurious lives. Moreover, they think that celebrities do not have to hide from publicity because it means that they are extremely popular with people and being loved. On the other hand, other people are against following celebrities and photographing them every moment. They claim that it is absolutely  intrusion on the privacy. What is more, they insist that before celebrities, they are also human-beings who want to live without being disturbed and watched. In conclusion, there are both advantages and disadvantages of covering celebrities. Taking everything  account, the drawbacks far outweigh its benefits. Thus, I think that journalists should consider celebrities' lives and be in celebrities' shoes.  ",33.00
161," Dear Sir/Madam: I'd like to complain about your 'Best' musical show that I went to when I'd a week's holiday in London. I felt really disappointed because the things you said in the advertisement wasn't true. I went there at 19.00 because the show started at 19.30 as the advertisement said but I queued for at least an hour because the ticket machine broke down. Finally, after an hour, when my term came to buy the entrance ticket, you staff said I couldn't have a discount and so as anyone. However I bought the ticket even  it was more expensive because I'd been queuing for ages and I really wanted to see my favourite idol, Danny Brook. But when the show started, they said Danny wasn't there because of his illness and I felt very upset and dismayed about it because the situation I had was unlike what the advertisement said. After the boring show finished, I was hungry and I decided to go to your theatre restaurant but the restaurant was closed after 19.00. So what's the point  to say 'visit our restaurant after the show'? I'd a very disappointing evening and my anger influenced me for the rest of my holidays. I'd like to know if you can give the money back to me or I'll write letters to all the media departments to show how tricky you were. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. He went to see the headmaster and told him all the truth. Tim was the one who threw the paper aeroplane to the headmaster and Jon was the one who said some bad words behind the headmaster  after he punished Jon. The headmaster was extremely angry about it and he gave both students a heavy punishment, which was suspended from school for a week. This happened in the Thursday afternoon. When everyone finished their lunch, they all got into their classrooms quickly because they all knew that the headmaster would walk round the school every Thursday. But some naughty students in my class were throwing paper aeroplanes when the teacher was writting something on the board. Unfortunately, one of the paper planes flew out of the window and hit directly to the headmaster's head. Everyone was laughing and the headmaster's face was full of anger. He then punished Jon but the one who did  was Tim so Jon was very angry and he said something bad about the headmaster among us. Pat heard that and  went to see the headmaster straight after school. The headmaster went to see Jon and Tim and punished  their bad behaviours. After that event happened, Pat was Jon and Tim's enemy. They both got into trouble because of him. They do hate him so much.

940," Dear Helen Ryan: My name is Julia Sanches and I have won first prize in your competition. I am now writing to tell you the information you have asked  about me: I would like to travel on July because I will be on my school vacation, so I would not miss my classes. About the activities, I would like to do Basketball and Surfing. I play Basketball at school twice a week and I enjoy it. Although I do not play perfectly, I play quite well, but I would still like to practice. I go to the beach almost every weekend to improve my surfing - it is the sport I like best - and I think it would be a nice oportunity to practice surfing too. There are some things I would like to ask : the tipe (and quantity) of Clothes I will have to take,  if it is necessary to take some money and any additional stuff (like raincoates). Well, that would be all. I look forward to receiving your letter. Yours sincerely, Julia Sanches  [SEP]  IS EVIL INTERESTING? Since we are kids people tell us stories with two sides in conflit: the good and the bad side. The good always wins, and we are told that the other part is bad, and that is the end of the story. But isn't evil interesting? On the tale ""It's a good life"", the author gives much more emphasis to the Witte Anthony than to anyone else in the story. He is the main character, although he is mean, cruel and uningative. He controls the other people using the power of his mind. Although the other people on the story are the good ones and suffer with his domination, they are quite poor and empty, not interesting and not well described, meanwhile Anthony is a very interesting and different person, and all his thoughts are told  us by the author. In conclusion, even though we know that this character is good and this one is bad, sometimes the good ones are quite boring, and we find the bad one much more interesting. ",29.0
880," Dear Helen, I was very glad to receive this great notice. I am very excited about it. I entered in this competition because I have always wanted to do these kind of things. In your letter you asked me when I would rather travel, I will be able  only on July because I have to work and I can take some days off on this month. If it is no problem I would rather stay in a lab cabin because I do not like much sleeping on the floor, but if you can not put me there I will be fine anywhere. About the  I have to choose I would like to tell you something. I am very good at tennis and photography but I would prefer to practice new ones, if it is possible. I am keen on water and risk sports so I would choose climbing and surfing, I think it would be great if I learn them while I am there. Finally, I would like to ask you if there is any place where I can buy some souvenirs, so to take some money with me and I would be very grateful if you could send me a list of clothes. Thank you for everything. I am looking forward to travelling. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Every woman in the world likes the word shopping. It is like if they lose their concience while they are shopping. You can do shopping alone, with friends or with your kids, but the best thing of it is that you feel that you have all the power while you are buying things. May be it is not for you, may be it is a present, but buying things at least for me it is the best. But all this power and all this excitement could turn into something that you could start to hate. When you go shopping and there are a lot of people in the same place, all trying to find the best prices and not carying about anybody, this could get crazy to anyone. The long queues, close places, hight prices, sales, all these things conbined could make shopping an enjoyable thing for people who like doing it. But my advise for people, who like it so much that  can not help doing it, is to try shopping in the afternoon, at this hour no-one do shopping and if there are some shops that are closed you can always go to a shopping mall.

138," 17/06/00 mr. MANAGER MY NAME  JAMES CAMIREZ AND I'AM WRITING THIS LETTER TO YOU BECAUSE I HAVE SOME COMPLEINTS FOR THE DISAPPOINTING EVENING I HAD LAST NIGHT. FIRST OF ALL ON THE ADVERTISEMENT FOR THE SHOW IT SAYS THAT THE ACTOR WAS GOING TO BE DANNY BROOK AND INSTEAD OF HIM  WAS A TOTALLY UNKNOWN CLOWN THAT HAD NO IDEA OF HOW TO ACT, IT WAS HORRIBLY DISAPPOINTING! SECOND I GOT TO THE THEATRE AT 19.20 BECAUSE IN THE ADVERTISEMENT IT CLEARLY APPEARS THAT THE SHOW STARTS AT 19.30, AND I GOT HEAVILY MAD WHEN I LOOK  MY WATCH AND NOTICE THAT I HAD BEEN WAITING FOR 40 (FORTY) MINUTES AND THE SHOW DIDN'T START YET...I MEAN I WAS AMAIZING! THEN I READ ON THE ADVERTISEMENT, DISCOUNTS AVAILABLE, AND I DIDN'T GOT ANY DISCOUNTS WHEN I ASKED FOR THEM. AFTER THE SHOW I GOT OUT  THE SHOW ROOM DEEPLY DISAPPOINTED AND WENT TO THE RESTAURANT TO DRINK SOMETHING TO RELAX, AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT?.. IT WAS CLOSED! I COULDN'T BELIVE IT HOW THIS CLASS OF THEATRE CAN BE SO .. OH I'M GETING MAD AGAIN SO I'AM GOING TO TELL YOU THE LAST THING, IT WAS THE  HORRIBLE NIGHT I HAD EVER GOT SO I DEMEND FOR MY MONEY BACK!  [SEP]  I THINK THAT MODERN TECHNOLOGY HAS AFFECTED ALL THE HUMAN BEINGS. MODERN TECHNOLOGY HAS AFFECT ME IN SEVERAL WAYS, I MEAN THE MORE THE TECHNOLOGY MODERNIZES;  MORE CONFORTNESSCOMFORTABLE WE GET. NOW WITH MODERN MACHINES I CAN MAKE A BETTER USE OF MY TIME, IF I'AM LATE TO GO TO TRAINING AND I HADN'T IT YET I JUST TAKE MY FOOD AND PUT IT IN THE MICROWAVEOVEN. ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS THE COMPUTERS, I THINK THEY ARE ONE OF THE MOST ADVANCED MACHINE IN THE WORLD, YOU CAN LIVE YOUR ENTIRE LIFE IN A HOUSE WITHOUT GOING OUT, BY JUST USING THE INTERNET, IT HAS ALSO HELPED ME IN MY SCHOOL HOMEWORK, I MEAN IT'S INCREDIBLE THE TIME YOU WAIST BY MAKING THING WITHOUT A COMPUTER. BUT I THINK ALSO THAT WITH MODERN TECHNOLOGY WE GET MORE COMFORTABLE SO THAT MAKES ME A PACIVE PERSON AND NOT SO ACTIVE, THIS CAN BE BAD TO BECAUSE IF I GET USED TO BE CONFORTABLE WHEN I NEED TO DO HARD WORKS I WON'T BE ABLE TO DO THEM.

475," 17th June, 2000 Dear Sir/Madam: Or to whom it main concern: I am writting to you because I had a very disappointing evening at the Circle Theatre. Well I seems to me that you should know what had happened there. First of all, I read your advertisement where it was written that the musical show started at 19.30, but do you know at what hour it started? It started at 20:15! Don't you think it is a lack of respect? Really it was. I forgot to tell you that there were no available discounts. And  tickets were too expensive! Most people couldn't afford them. As a matter of fact, when the musical show was over, I was really hungry. But as I had read your advertisement I knew there was a restaurant. So I went there in order to have something to eat. But can you believed it, it was closed. Absolutely closed. So I asked someone who seemed to be in charge, and he told me that it was too late to have a meal. This really disappoint me. I was both hungry and angry. Well I think that is all, but I will ask you to give  my money back. Looking forward  hearing from you. yours Faithfully  [SEP]  Secrets Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Maybe this is how my story begins. Well first of all Pat was a very  friend of mine. He was really a good friend, until something had happened. I was attending college, as I normally do. With nothing to lose, at all, but on the contrary, with a lot to learn from. I was very keen on English lessons, maybe because I was sitting near the Boy I loves. Yes, I think this was the only reason. His name was Cody. He was a very handsome and good looking boy. But far from that, he was a very kind person. Pat told me that he was also in love with me. He told me that it was nessary to do something about . But I didn't know what to do. Pat suggested me to talk to him. But I really didn't managed to do so. As Pat was lossing his patience, he decided to talk to him. I can say that I was very nervious or anxious about what was going to happen. He didn't kept my secret. Pat told him that I was in love with him. This was my secret and now it was not. But  so, I think it was for the best, he was also in love with me. But on the other hand I will never trust in Pat.

Well, I start to make a plan for my travel, and the only time I have is on July because I will be finish my course of language at St Jame's School. About accomodation I would prefer  cabins, because I suffer  alergic, and I think  tend, would be not very suitable for my health. I am very happy to have the opportunity to do some sports. I'm very good in swimming and surfing. Swiming I won last summer competition in the school, although I'm not very good at surfing I like , and I always practis in my holidays every year.

982," Dear Mrs Ryan, Thank you for your letter of 13 June. I am very happy to have won the first prize in your competition. I would like to travel only in July, because I have only one month holliday this year. I would prefer to sleep in a tent, because I think  is a great fun and a bit more adventurous. It is not too much confortable, but it is not a problem for me, I like this kind of holliday. I am keen on photography so I would love to participated at this activity, I am very good at that and it would be a pleasure for me to help the others. I also will take painting, because I always dream about painting, but I never try to, so I think it is a good occasion. I would be grateful if you could tell me what kind of clothes I have to take with  and how many money, more or less, do you think I should take. Thank you  to ask me  my taste and to be preoccupated about it. I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible. Yours sincerely, Audrey Gillett  [SEP]  Dear Kim, Like you know last month, I had helped at a pop concert and I enjoyed it a lot. Firstly I had to make the decor of the scene, so I made in the background a sky with a lot of bright stars. Then I put  some blue lights. furthermore I made some stars in paper in argent color. But that was only the begining of my adventure. The most exiting part was when I had to make up the pop stars ! I never had met pop stars before and I was very impresed, but I was too happy to show my shyness. Do you believe that I spoke with Micheal Jackson, my favourite singer? I can't believe it yet! It was a wonderful experience. I will remember that day for the rest of my life. It was like a dream who becomes tru. I wish you had been there with me. I can't explain how supper it was. I stayed with him until the concert begun and after the show I had the opportunity to stay in his private room with him and the other dansers. Well, I have to leave you now, but I will tell you more details when we next meet each other. See you soon. Love, Audrey ",31.0
66," Dear Miss Clark, I went to your annual international arts festival. I really enjoyed it, although I feel it could have been better. But firstly I want to congratulate you for organizing such a huge festival, people need this kind of events. Secondly I would like to make some remarks about your festival so that you can improve it. As it was written  in your advertisement, artists should have come from around the world but only six countries were represented, I was quite disappointed. However the concerts were great, but unfortunately, some concert halls were too small and it was as hot as a micro-wave inside. Plays and Films were good and I liked them, but there were only a few, I hope there will be many more next year. One of the most positive aspect of your festival is the price of your weekend ticket. As a student, the low priced ticket certainly athacted me a lot and gave me the opportunity to see and hear wonderful artists. Finally, I would like to make one big suggestion: you should find a place for a camping so that people who come from a long way don't have to spend money on accomodation. Anyway, I'm looking forward to coming to your festival next year. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Money, Money, Money Young people always need money, specially students who don't earn their life. They need money to pay  their studies or for going out, but how to find a job which is good and not under-paid? One of the best is working in a big supermarket. Some can find it boring but it is well-paid and not too tiring. Furthermore departement stores are always looking for students who would like to work. Another solution could be working as a barman, the problem is that you go to bed very late, but it's very exciting because you meet a lot of people and enjoy your night. Unfortunately it's not possible unless you can rest in the morning. If you are a really good student in one subject, you can provide private lessons which is one of the most prolific job but do it only if you like teaching. Otherwise you should try to find another job. The main thing to remember is that there  many possibilities but you have to try to find them and not just say: ""I want to work and earn money"".

61," Dear Jane Clark, I'm writing to you to give my opinion of that great festival you organiced the last 21 and 22 of November. I want you to know how  extraordinary moments I passed with my friends in the festival. Your work was brilliant because you brought stars and artists from around the world with only that reasonable-priced ticket we paid for all the weekend. The festival was very well organiced with a lot of alternatives like concerts and dance shows. On my point of view the hall of the rock concets was too small, you've to consider make a big one for the next year because these kind of events are concurred by a lot of young people. In conclusion, I wanted to say thanks for such an special weekend. Yours Sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Miguel Thanks for your letter. I got it a couple of days ago and I've been thinking about what you said. I'm going to tell you what I feel. In my house rules practically don't exist because I have 18 years old now so my parents only wish is that I study  a carrear and be a good man. They only want to know where I am and when I go out  at what time I came home. At school  is complete different because the teachers don't foregive you nothing. You have to be quiet an attention in class if you wouldn't  to be punished. I'm happy because my parents allow me to do a lot of things. I wouldn't like to change anything because we all need some dicipline to make the right things. When I'd time I will write  you again Love, ",20.00
949," Dear Mrs Ryan, I'm writing to give you the information you requested in your letter dated March, 31st, in which you informed me that I have won first prize in your competition. I can only travel in July, because the Hospital I work for has accepted my holidays on that month. I don't mind if I travel during the first fortnight or during the second one, although I would prefer travelling during the second fortnight, if it is possible. Regarding the accommodation, I would prefer staying in  log cabins. I have never liked staying in tents because I think they are uncomfortable, especially if the stay is going to last more than two or three days. It's difficult for me to chose two activities from your list, but I think I would like to play basketball. I have never been good at team sports, but I really like basketball and I think it can be very interesting to meet other people by means of this team sport. I like swimming too, because I think it is one of the best sports to keep you fit and healthy. I would be very grateful if you could give me some aditional information. What type of clothes must I take? Is it necessary to take dressed cloth for any formal events? Must I take cash money or can I use the credit cards? Thank you in advance for your help. I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Kim, Thanks for your last letter. I can understand why you are impatient to hear about my experience at the concert last month. I have met our favourite singer, Celine Dion! She is wonderful. But, first of all, let me explain to you what I did during the concert. We arrived at the stadium the previous evening. The team of volunteers was a great one, and all of us were willing to help in anything they needed . Firstly, we were asked to clear the stadium, especially the seats and surroundings. When we finished clearing, some of us offered our help to enter the sound equipment into the stadium. They said that it wasn't necessary and we sat down on the grass and observed how the scenary was being prepared for the concert. And then, when all was prepared, Celine appeared in the scenary to make some sound tests. I was astonished. It was incredible! I was so near her! When she finished the tests, I went to meet her, I told her I was very happy for staying there and having helped at the concert, and I asked her  an authograph. She gave it to me with a great smile and gave permission to take a photograph of both of us. And she dedicated the photograph to me! I still believe it has only been a dream! I am willing to show you the authograph and the photograph. Please, make sure you can come next weekend. We will be able to talk bout the concert and we will listen together to the last Celine Dion's C.D. Let me know if you are going to come so that I  prepare the bedroom to put you up . Please, come!

1016," 12.12.2000 Dear Mr Robertson, I am writing to ask permission to go to the London Fashion and Leisure Show. I would be very greatful if you could let us to go  the show. I would like to give you some details about the show that I saw  its advertisement yesterday. It is in the Central Exhibition Hall in London. It starts at 10.00 am and finishes  19.00 pm. The date of the show is on Tuesday  14th of March. It is  really great opportunity to go to the show when we are in London. We would like to go there because it is very popular nowadays. I've heard that  Leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles are really wonderful. It is also free for students. We all know that you organised everything. However, we can change the programme. Here are some suggestions that I would like to let you know. We have  free timer on Wednesday  15th of March in the afternoon so we can go to the Science Museum on Wednesday. We can also do  shopping quickly after sightseeing of London. I would be very pleased if you let us to go to the show. I also would like to say thank you for organising the good program for us. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  A DAY OF MY LIFE It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. That day, I got up early because I hadn't slept very well. I checked everything again and again. I was afraid of doing it but I had to do it. It was the first time I had robbed a bank. I was her best friend. I promised her  to find a money for her operation. She was at the hospital and she was really bad. That time, I couldn't imagine how my life would change. After I had had my breakfast I put my clothes on. I didn't want anybody to recognise me. Despite feeling really bad I left home. I got into my car and started it. When I arrived  the bank I got out of the car and went into the bank. I told everybody to lie down. They did it. I asked  cashier to give me all  money. Before I took  money one of the cashier had pressed a button to call a police. I quickly left  bank. However, it didn't take long that they caught me soon. The policeman arrested me and I stayed in a prison for 15 years. The worst thing was my friend died after 10 days I was arrested. ",25.00
893," Dear Helen Ryan. I am writing to reply  your letter about my first prize in your competition and give you all  information for my two weeks at Camp California. First of all, I  prefer travelling in July, because it will be my school vacation and I'm not allowed to travel during school times. It'd be great if I could be accommodated in  tents, because I've never slept in  tents before, and I think it is an interesting experience. Secondly, the two activities wich I'd like to pratice during the campsite are sailing and surfing. I have already surfed when I was travelling in Brazil, but since them I have hadn't a chance to do it again. Although I know how surfing, I have no idea about sailing, I just only read about it and I am very interested  to practice. Is there any problem? I'd like to ask you some questions: Is  necessary bring  money to the Camp? How much? And about clothes? What is more appropiated? Finally, I want to thank you for the great opportunity I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely. Camila Beatriz de J. Branco  [SEP]  A programme  not often good. Shopping is said that an enjoyable programme in all situations. However sometimes it isn't so wonderful as it seems to be. When you go to a sale shop it is dificult to find what you look for without a help of the shop assistant. The problem is find a shop assistant who hear  your problems and can help you. After that you have to wait a long time in the qeue to pay and many times  isn't possible pay with your credit card and you don't have a money in cash. So you had lost hours to buy nothing. You can't talk to  manager even to give him suggestions  to improve his business, because he is always absent. And don't try to complain to someone else because they won't hear you. To conclude, although you can have good moments while shopping all of us know that it is not always enjoyable, isn't it? ",29.0
188," 17th December 2000 Dear Sirs, I am writing to complain about my awful evening at the Circle Theatre. I am very disappointed. Last week I went to see a musical show called 'OVER THE RAINBOW' at the Circle Theatre. I was first, very excited to see the show, because on the advertisement it said that it is the best musical in London. Also it said that I can have a perfect evening at there, but it turned out to be a very disappointing evening. I went to see my favourite actor Danny Brook acting in the show, but he was not there. I was shocked. There was another man acting. The show started late then I expected. It should be from 7,30 p.m, but it was from 8.15 p.m.! I want to complain about the ticket. On the advertisement it said that discounts are availble, but when I asked a staff in the theatre about the discount he didn't offer me one. After the show I went  the 'THEATRE RESTAURANT' to have dinner, but the restaurant was closed. It was because they closed early than usual. I think they should keep the times correctly. I am very disappointed with everything what happened last week. I would like a refund. I excpect this will be possible. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Fashion of the Future by XXX 17/6/00 My article is about fashion in.  future Right now in 2000 many people are wearing modern clothes. Like wearing T-shirts, trousers, skirts, coats, long-sleeved shirts, jumpers, etc. They also wear little items on them to go with their clothes. Like earings, necklaces, bracelets, rings, glasses, hairbands, hand bags, shoes, watches, etc. They like designers clothes and everyone wear different modern clothes in size, in colour and in shapes. The fashion gradually changed from the old days and it is still changing to the future. Maybe in 100 years from now, fashion will be totally different. Everyone may think that in  future people will wear silver clothes like in space movies. I think everyone will wear balloons for clothes in  future. Every one will wear very colourful balloons on them. With balloon clothes they will be able to fly up in the sky. Everyone will not walk on roads. They will bounced on roads with there balloon clothes. In  future they will wear balloon clothes, because to make people fly. They will use a special gas inside  balloons to make them fly. For the special gas they will mix carbon dioxide and some chemicals. This special gas will be not dangerous. If we use up carbon dioxide with  balloon clothes there will be less carbon dioxide on Earth, so there is no worry about Ozone breaking. This is one more reason to wear balloon clothes in  future. It is to save our Earth. Would you like to wear balloon clothes and bounce around the world? If yes, wait until  2100s! ",28.0
765," Dear Helen Ryan I am writting about this letter that I recently received from you, which is about a competition that I have won the first prize. I would like to know if  is possible for me going on July, because I have school on the others months, and it is impossible for me going on December or January. About the accommodation, I would prefer  log cabins instand of  tents, because  is safer and more confortable. The two activities that I prefer will be Basketball, because I had the experience to play in my school's big for almoust a year, and Photography, which is a hobby that I am good at and I practice since I was ten. On top of everything, I would like to ask how much money should I take, and which type of clothes are the best to wear in the competition. Yours sincerely Elisa F.  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable If you are used to go to the Shopping very often, maybe  is because you don't know about all the others good things you can do on your weekend. People are used to go to the shopping because it is easier and familiare, it is one place where you can have lunch or dinner, watch some movie after that, and if you want buy something at the shops. On the other hand, everything at the shopping is more expensive, because the people that buy on it usually don't compare prices or look for cheaper shops, because all they need it is already at this place. Instand of going to the theather, which is more cultural, or even do a picnic on the Ikurapiura park, people prefer spends all their money at Shoppings. So, why don't we try to change our customs and start to do knew things to enjoy ourselves. ",27.0
141," Dear Sir, I am writing to complain about the musical show ""Over the rainbow"" performed at ""The Circle Theatre"" on the 20th of May. To begin with, the show was supposed to start at 19:30 but, due to a ""technical problem"", as they said, it started at 20:15. However, it would not have been such a great problem if the show on the proved to be as good as they promised but it really was not worth seeing, especially because the first actor was not Danny Brook as we expected but an unknown, clearly an inexperienced young actor, named Tom Douglas. What is more, there were no discounts available for the ticket fees nor we had the opportunity to visit the theatre restaurant, as it was closed for mourning reasons. I am not satisfied with the service we received, I am therefore writing for a full refund and I expect to receive by post a cheque for £20. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  LIKE BLIND SHEEP In the 21st century, people will all the wearing the same clothes, the same shoes, they will be buying the same accessories. We'll get out in the morning and find out that our neighbour wears our same jacket and he's boasting about a pair of shoes which are too similar to ours. The thing is we are too fashion conscious, too fussy about our appearance and we'll end up forking out for smart clothes only because the people next door are doing so!! The reason why we'll do this is that we need to be accepted by the elite group that decide who you must be and how you must behave. They make you think there's noting left to do but to surrender and do what you've been told to, like blind sheep. Anyway, I don't really mind what people will be wearing in 100 years' time. As for me the only thing I care for in the morning is that I don't have my socks mismatched! ",29.0
500," 17th JUNE 2000. DEAR SIR, I AM WRITING TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE PROBLEMS WHICH OCCURRED IN THE LAST MUSICAL SHOW OF THIS THEATRE. FIRST OF ALL, DIFFERENTLY OF ADVERTISED, THE MAIN ACTOR WAS NOT DANNY BROOK, BUT OTHER UNKNOWN PERSON. TO MAKE MATTER WORSE, THE SHOW DELAYED STARTING AT 20:15. AS IF THIS WERE NOT ENOUGH, I DID NOT OBTAIN A DISCOUNT IN THE PRICE OF THE TICKET, ALTHOUGH THIS WAS POSSIBLE ACCORDING TO YOUR LEAFLET. ON TOP OF EVERYTHING, I COULD NOT VISIT THE RESTAURANT OF THIS PLACE, BECAUSE IT WAS CLOSED AFTER THE SHOW. I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED, BECAUSE THAT EVENING OUT WAS NOT  PERFECT AS I HAD PLANNED. SO, I WOULD BE GRATEFUL IF YOU COULD REFUND OF ALL OR PART OF MY MONEY WHICH I PAID FOR THE SHOW. I LOOK FORWARD TO RECEIVING YOUR PROMPT REPLY. YOURS FAITHFULLY, MARCOS ALMO BRAS DE BARODO.  [SEP]  IT'S UNDENYABLE THAT DURING THIS CENTURY OUR WORLD HAS BEEN CHANGING. NEWS INVENTS HAVE BEEN INVENTED AND THE SCIENCE HAS BEEN IN QUICK PROGRESS. AS A RESULT OF THIS PEOPLE'S DAILY LIFE HAS BEEN CHANGING AS WELL. AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT, IT'S WORTH TO POINTING OUT THE FOLLOWING: FIRST AND FOREMOST, IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT TODAY IT IS EASIER TO TRAVEL AROUND THE WORLD BECAUSE NOWADAYS THERE ARE LOTS OF GOOD AND FAST WAYS OF TRANSPORT. IN THE SAME WAY, WE CAN TRAVEL INSIDE OUR COUNTRY QUICKLY AND SAFELY. CONSEQUENTLY, WE'VE GOT FACILITIES TO KNOW MANY DIFFERENT PLACES AND TO CONTACT DIFFERENT PEOPLE, TOO. SECONDLY, WE CAN'T FORGET EITHER THAT ALL OF US HAVE  CONDITIONS TO COMMUNICATE WITH PEOPLE BY MOBILE PHONES, BY  INTERNET, WHO LIVE NOT ONLY IN THIS COUNTRY, BUT ALSO ABROAD. FINALLY, WE CAN CONSIDER, TOO, THAT THE TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN PROVIDING US WITH IMPORTANT DISCOVERIES, MAINLY IN MATTERS ABOUT HEALTH,  ENVIRONMENT AND SO ON. IN CONCLUSION, I REALLY BELIEVE THAT OUR DAILY LIFE IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN IT WAS IN THE LAST CENTURY AND EVEN IN THE BEGGINING OF THIS CENTURY. THE SCIENCE AND THE TECHNOLOGY ARE THE MAIN RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS. ",29.0
1139," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing with reference to your advertisement which I read in a local newspaper two days ago. As I took part in this activities weekend, which was organised by the college, I would like to express my dissatisfaction to your article. First of all, your advertisement mentions that the course had to be cancelled, because the teacher was ill, but the course cancelled only  the last afternoon. Secondly, you mention that no body registered for the local history course. So I would like to inform you that 32 attended to this course. Thirdly, as far as the painting and photography courses   is true what you say, they were very popular. I think that the reason for being these courses so popular is that people are very interested in these kind of activities. Apart from this the teachers was very experienced and the equipment was particullarly coteporary. Furthemore, your article mentions that the weekend cost over £100. That is not true. The cost was only £60 including lunch. Last but not least, the college is planning to run another activities weekend next term, so it will be sooner than you mention. Finaly, I would like to tell you that the weekend was not as disappointing as you mention bud I would like to thank you for you kind attention to my letter, and I would like you to write another article which will lit to the truth Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Dear Jane, I am very happy because I haven't received any letter from you, for  long time, and as I had a problem with my mother's health, not  serious , I didn't write to you. I hope you are fine. First of all, you musn't panic. It's not  serious enough problem to get upset. You must be very happy because you have been offed two jobs. In my opinion as you're really very keen on history, I think that the ideal job for you is to work in a museum. Now I don't know if it is tiring but I suppose it will be less tiring than a place in a restaurant. If I were in your shoes, I would choose the position to the museum because it is more stimulating and as the pay is about the same, I think that this choice is the best for you. But you should wonder which working place is more convenient to you. You'd  better not to travel far away from your home. Also working in a museum  include big tips from the tourists. Apart from these, despite the fact that it is a summer job you could be employed for the whole  next year, if you are lucky. Last but not last, I hope you will find my opinion helpful I wish your problem will be solved, but I don't think that it's about a problem. Whatever choice you will make I'm sure it will be the best for you. Drop me a line. Lots of Love, ",34.0
785," Dear Mrs. Ryan: Thank you very much for your letter. I am so glad to know I won the first prize. Regarding your questions, the following are my answers. The only time available for me to travel is July, any time during the month suits me. I need to insist in it, because I am not able to take holidays during the rest of the year. I will love to be in a log cabin. They are more comfortable and really match with the enveiroment. It is not easy to chose from the list of activities, all of them look interesting. Although this is a new experience, I would prefer climbing and Photographe. The first one sounds like a great adventure, while the second will allow me to capture all the unforgettable views. In addition, I would appreciate  if you let me know what is the kind of clothing required for the Camp; if I need some money there and for what; and finally if the prize is just for me or if I can go with somebody else. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Kim: Finally I'm writing to let you know about the most exciting experience in my life. Can you believe that I was helping in the last Britney Spears's Concert? During the day I helped preparing her room, then she arrived, and I was there to continue helping. She was so kind with all of us, of course I asked her for an autograph. I hope to see you soon, I can't wait to show it . The concert was a big success,  lot of excitment. Everybody sang and danced, and I was there to see everything from the best position. Each time, when she comes back to the room, she asked for something to drink, just a diet coke, because she's always looking after her weight. Then she eat something small and she looks full of energy all night long. At the end, she took the time to say good by to all of the people helping her. I really think she's the best. But now, tell me about you. Don't be lazy and write more often. ",29.0
1042," Dear Mr Robertson: Firstly, I'm very glad to hear from you. Thank you for being organised the programme for our class, I think you may think about a long time that how shall we study during  three days. We have seen your programme, and like all of those , especially the Science Museum, it will  good for us to increase our knowledge, and so on. Secondly, I wonder if you know it will have ""London fashion and Leisure "" be showed on Tuesday in  Central Exhibition Hall. In other words, what they will introduce, is most interested in us, I mean it's conflict with your plan, what a pity! All of us want to go to the show, the generation who are the same ago with us all like make up, become beautiful, and it's important that it will  free for students and just be showed  one day. So, we don't want lose this chance. Finally, we would like to get your permition to go, maybe if it is possible that you  change your programme, we may be going to your college any time after Tuesday. We're sorry to give you trouble. We look forward to hearing from you again as soon as possible. Best Wishes  [SEP]  It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. This story happed two years ago. That was a very hot summer, every people in our city like to swim in the river, perhaps they didn't think it was interesting if they swimed in the pool. Personally, I'd like to say I was good at swimming. Not only I was a member of  swimming team in our school, but also I was tought by my father since I was five years old, So I would understood some skills and  how to protect yourself from my Dad, if you had a accident. One day, I passed by a river in accident, I saw there were a lot of people playing in the river. Suddenly, I heard  of ""help, help"" in my distance. In a while, lots of passed-by crowed to the river-side. To my surprise, nobody want  to save that boy who was shouting,  just stood there, like lots of ""champ"". I started think about it, after all, either had I neve done this task before, or trained. I  just 15 years old. Finally, I jumped into the river, I really knew that was dangerous, but I haven't think about anything except ""justify"" this word. I also extremely hated those people who stood there all the time. Thank goodness, I succeed,  save that struggled child. When I went the river-side bank, I saw some red-faced. ",22.00
306," Dear Sir, I am writing with reference to an arrangement I made for your theatre show last week. I have to admit that it was not as I expected; First of all, the main reason I went to see ""Over the Rainbow"" was its actor, Danny Brook. It was very disappointing when I realised he wasn't in the scene. Beside this, I had to wait three quarters of  hour before the show started. During this time, I decided to have a drink in the restaurant but, as well as being closed, there was no nobody from the staff that could help me. I couldn't believe it! I would never have imagined this could happen in such a well-known theatre. Furthermore, you talk about discounts in your leaflets and they were no available, so, it was an expensive evening! I know you will understand my frustration and that's why I would like a total refund of my money or at least another ticket that goes with my wishes. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. However, she was a close friend and I couldn't accuse her of nothing else. I won't never forget the day the doctor told me and my Mum the thruth of my strange disease. He just said there weren't resources to face it at that moment but... I bursted into teas as well as my Mother. It seemed the end of something lovely step by step. I got conscious of my problem and despite being a personal matter I decided to tell it to Pat. I still remember her words: ""Don't worry about anything. My lips are sealed"". I do really trusted her when three days after I went to school and I could appreciate I was catching the eyes of everybody. I couldn't stand being watched and my furious led me straight to Pat. She tried to apologise but it wasn't enough for me. My best friend had let me down. From that moment, I denied being with anyone until I met Cold, a sensitive dog, the one who would keep my secrets forever and would be near me until the end. Sure! ",29.0
1089," Dear Mr Robertson I am writing to request your permission for us to visit the London Fashion and Leisure Show on 14th March. First of all, I would like to say thank to you for this good programme, especially  the decision of going to visit in London. All of us is appreciated that we could have this opportunity. Because most students have never been to London before, also we could visit some famous places which we wanted to go . However, we would be grateful if you would arrange a time to visit the show additionally. This show takes place at  Central Exhibition Hall on Tuesday from 10:00 to 19:00. In this show, not only can we see  latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles, but we also can enter for free. Moreover some students think that they would like to do fashion studies in future. If you would accept and wouldn't mind this idea, we would like to visit it instead of shopping in the afternoon on Tuesday. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Nowadays, quite a few famous people suffer  their private life from disturbers such as journalists or reporters. I would like to think how  media effect to famous people. Few years ago, we had a terrible news of  death of Lady Diana. She was always been aftering by  media. She had no private life even though she wanted to be alone. Finally, after chasing for  long time, she was dead because of  car accident. It must be a good example of  media disaster. I understand she had a good reason to be chased by it. However she definetely deserve to have a private life as one of citizen. Human right must be existed for all people. On the other hand, there are  few famous people  desire to be watched by  media. If  media stopped focusing  the people, they would think as if they are put in a bin like rubbish. Moreover, many people love to watch a gossip programme on TV or  in a magazine. It is one  of fun in our life. On balance, ",24.00
1045," Dear Mr Robertson, First of all, I would like to say thank you to you Mr Robertson for planning to take us to spend three days in London. Your programme looks very interesting, especially the River Trip to Greenwich, which I always dreamt of. However, we have seen an advertisement on the English magazine for the London Fashion and Leisure Show. It takes place at the Central Exhibition Hall in London on Tuesday March 14 at 10.00-19.00. The show will have  latest fashions from  top fashion designers in the world. Leisure show will have leisure and sports wear, new make up style and new hair style for next year. The best thing is that it is free because we are students. We would like to ask you whether we can change some  programme. Our suggestion is that we can go shopping on Wednesday 15 March so on Tuesday afternoon we can go to The London Fashion and Leisure Show. We won't miss any programme that you have planned and we could also have  great opportunity to see the show. We're looking forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully.  [SEP]  ""Famous people, such as politicians and film stars, deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time"". In my opinion, everybody wants to have a happy life in our own world, we want to do whatever we want, sometimes we do the right things and sometimes we do the wrong things. We are ordinary people, we work and come home to have activities with our family or go out together. The politicians and film stars also want to have a normal life after work. They want to have a private life without journalists following them all the time. Although, their news on the front page of a magazine can catch the eyes of  public so that people will never forget them. On the other hand, their story always make them embarras because most of the journalists create their own story base on the true story just to get  attraction from people. I think, if the journalist want to publish the politicians and film stars private life, they should have asked for permission. They deserve to have a private life as everybody .  ",28.00
348," Dear Sir, I went to your show called ""Over The Rainbow"" and I was really disappointing in many points. Firstly, you spoke about two actors Danny Brook and Tina Truelove,  instead of them we had two others and they were really bad. So I was really surprised. In addition to this you started the show 45 minutes late. It was boring for everybody. How could we appreciate the show properly. Moreover, in your advert you spoke about discounts available but it was not the case. No discounts were available. Then you offered people to visit your theatre restaurant after the show but it was closed because there is no staff to welcome the people. You offered something impossible to do. I did not have a good time for all of this reasons and I would like you to give  my money back. I hope your understand my request and you are going to reply as soon as possible. Thank you. yours sincerely O. Labro  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. The nightmare started at this time. I though she was a really good friend but I made a mistake. She couldn't keep my secret and everybody knew which boy I was in love with. She didn't tell me yet but when I came in  class everybody was looking at me and this boy as well. I looked at her and she became pale and suddently left the class. I followed her and caught her to push her on the ground. I was ready to fight but somebody stopped me. I couldn't go back to the class so I went home. My Mum was at home and I told her all the story. She said that I had to be strong and didn't care about them. So I went to the class and everybody was laughing at me and the boy told them to stopped because he loved me and wanted to be with me. At this time all the girls became jealous and stopped to laugh.

Firstly, I am afraid that I am just available to travel only in July because it is difficult to get my own holiday from my work a the moment. I prefer staying in tents to log cabins because I have really been interested in making tents and staying  there. Finally, if I have any chance to choose activities, I will choose Basket ball and Sailing with no doubt because I would love to make friends from these kinds of sports. Both could be exciting for me.

What I really want to say is about my recent experience. Last month, I helped at a pop concert by chance. I have just  as a normal worker but I have met so many famous singers who I ever seen on TV. Of course, I could listen to all their music which were so cool. After the concert I had got an opportunity to join them to the party. The best thing was that I have learned how to control their expensive instruments and I have sung my favorite songs with them. Especially, Mike who is a member of Metal Potato told me I had got a talent  to play the electric guitar. It is impossible to explain all my experience without this word, ""Brilliant!!!"". I would like to invite you to their next concert and share my experience with you. Please let me know if you want to come as soon as possible. Best wishes, KANG OFF WOO ",32.0
1185," Dear Mrs Smith, I am glad to helping you for the organisation of the international student conference. The group has been booked into the Palace Hotel, and the best way to get from there to the conference is by tube, the building of the conference is then five minutes by footh. At the end-of-conference there is a party, where we can eat something, dance and speak to each other about the conference. For the party I suggest you to wear classic clothes; maybe something black and not red or pink. I am going to wear black classic trousers and a white jorsey - it can be that this information give you some idea too.. On the last day we are going to have about three hours free times. What do you think if we will go to visit the Arts Museum? Of if we will go to hear a classic concert near the conference building's? I hope that I have been able to give you some help. and I am looking forward to seeing you at the conference. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Morgan, I am writing a report,  which  will describe  you the most important building of my town. The most important building of Biasco is the ,,Casa Cavalier Pellanda"". It is an old big house of a rich lord in the middle of the town. Into this house there is a big museum, where you could know  the past of Biasco. Under the museum there is a big dark place, where the wine is produced. Your American students could learn how the ,,Meriot ticinese"" is produced and why is it so famous in Tiano. I think that these suggestions could interest your student then Biasco, with its ,,Casa Cavalier Pellanda"", is the middle points of two tailes - Leventina and Blenio - and the middle points of two similar but also different cultures too. I hope that these informations will bring you to visit Biasco and its ,,house"". Yours faithfully, ",26.00
134," Olivier Peissaud The Manager Circle Theater Dear Sir, I am writing to complaint about a very disappointing evening I recently had during a week's holiday in London. My girlfriend and I read an advertisement about the show ""Over the Rainbow"" which is very popular. She is fond of the actor Danny Brook so I decided to buy two tickets, provided there were discounts available. When we asked for discounts tickets, we were said there never were discount offers and that we had to pay  the highest tickets - £20 each - because we were not English students. We were annoyed about it but we paid off. We took our places, and began chatting with other people. We had to wait  8.15 pm before it started whereas the show was supposed to start at 9.30 pm! Moreover, we were astonished that another actor we did not know was playing the role of Danny Brook. My girlfriend was very upset and so was I. After that we thought we could have a drink in your theatre restaurant but it was closed because the decorations were being changed. Finally we had the worst evening I have ever imagined, it was definitely not the ""perfect evening"" as written in the adverstiment. So I want my money back for these two tickets - I have included a copy  - and I hope you will pay more attention to the way you treat your customers, and avoid false advertisement. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Your children clothes in 100 years How interesting it is to imagine what kind of clothes people will wear in about a hundred years from now. Fashion is changing so quickly that all our dreams about clothes can become true. But let's see my point of view. In a hundred years,  clothes would certainly be totally differents than ours. Materials, textures and colours change, and are minds too. So I think people will wear clothes made of recycled things, like bottles of aluminium. And I hope colours won't be dark and sad but very bright and enjoyable to see. I think men will still wear pants and jackets but maybe not in jeans. Syntethic materials have grown up and become very popular so it would keep going on. But maybe the shape of the clothes will changed: large pants as ""baggy"", or trousers with many pockets as we see today. For women, clothes change more than for men's. It maybe because they are more likely to try new ways of clothes. I guess they will wear a sort of tunique upon a shirt and a skirt, or more male clothes because they want to change. Finally it's very difficult to say that . Maybe Luc Besson's ""Fifth Element"" movie is quite a good example. The clothes were designed by the famous Jean-Paul Gaultier. And it really is an interesting point of view. To conclude, in the end clothes won't be what we think about today, and it's a good thing because we can only imagine and follow the trend of fashion that makes us feel pretty and happy. ",36.0
209," Dear MANANGER of the theatre I'm writing just for the reason, to inform you how bad became the present , name ""OVER THE RAINBOW"". First of all in the describing of the show, the starring sould be Mr. DANNY BROOK, and it wasn't. Another thing was the started time , the show started forty five minutes late. So try to imagine my situation, I had paied a lot of money and I couldn't saw a good show, I am really disappointed. When the play ""over the Rainbow"" finished I tried to eat something, but the fact was that the theatre restaurant was closed, because your personal were cleaning all the troubles that a old dog did. But, the principal reason of this letter is to ask for some money back. I think that could be the best for everyone, and I'll like to give you an advice, if somebody pay you for a ticket, try to give the best you can. Hope hearing from you.  [SEP]  Unfortunatety, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. So, I'm going to tell  about my grandfather and his friend Pat: Many years ago, more or less seventy years  a young man with a exellent capacity of thinking and to invent materials things, started building a big thing called  ""time machine"". He worked day and night. Every day after having dinner Pat, his best friend, and my grandpa met to talk about their problems, but my Grandpa never told Pat about his new project. One month later, his worked was complete, but he was afraid of testing his machine, so he called Pat and spoke   about it. The only thing Pat should do, was to choose a date, the one he likes and to press the starter botton, and you know, what, he did it! The machine worked really good. The fact was that Pat choose to go to the year 2000, and when he arrived, he told every one that he was the inventor. That's why Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. THE END. ",25.0
600," Mrs Ryan, It had been a real joy to receive your  and I still can't believe it. In answer to your letter, you will find below the informations you need. I start my first job on August 1st, that's why I must travel on July. I can't change anymore the date of umployment because I signed the contract a month ago: I hope it will not make problems to you. For accomodation, I would prefer to have a log cabin, it would be better to let money or anything  without thinking of theft. I've always dreamed about climbing but I never have the opportunity to discover this sport. When I saw  you propose this sport, I was really excited. So I choose climbing as a beginner. For the second activity, I will choose sailing. I've done sailing for more than ten years and I really enjoy it. Moreover I was  sailing teacher on summers the past few years. Does Camp California provide all  clothes for sailing? Do I need to bring  money from Home? Or can I retire some at Camp California? Thank you very much. G Morin  [SEP]  Life at school is made of several things. first, lessons are the most important part of what school wants to provide us . But there are also a lots of clubs and activities that take part in the daily life of pupils. That's why they both have to be taken in account in the video we will make. The most interesting lessons for pupils are lessons in which we can do something real, concrete. for example, the lessons of mechanics or physics are very interesting. And especially the practical work. It would be great if we show it in our film, it might be also very interesting to watch it. For other activities, we could probably show a training one of our sport team. For example the team basketball which has won the student regional tittle (we can also say it) or the team of football. After all, it is not important the one we will show. but I think we must give a good picture of the school with sport. ",26.0

He knew everybody, especially Mrs Rilke, an elderly, eagle-eyed teacher in retirement, who lived in a old cottage with her five bad-tempered dogs. She has never received any letter, since that morning.  ""She was very angry when I arrived. She stared suspiciously at me through her glasses on the tip of her nose. After I had opened her gate, she called loudly  her five, horrible dogs. I realised I had to run away, but I had still her letter. Suddenly I made up my mind, and running as fast as a champion horse I reached her hands and left the letter, then I went away quickly and, fortunately,  just in time to close the gate between me and the dogs!

558," Dear Sir, After having read your letter, I write to you to inform you that I would like to travel in July. It is the only month where I don't work. As for the accommodations I would prefer a tent, there's nothing like hearing raindrops on canvas at night! Last but not least, I would like to go sailing and climbing. I have sailed some in my youth but have never went climbing. It would be a fun experiance! Will I be needing any money. Please send me a list of needed clothes and/or supplies. Thank you very much. Yours sincerely, Gilbert Neville P.S. I would like to know if there is a medical staff present during the two weeks? Does any medication  have to be declared to them? In case of any accidents, will the transport back home be paid for?  [SEP]  Why can shopping be unenjoyable? First of all, it depends on who is with you and what the other person likes to shop for. Some people are boring to shop with, they don't talk or comment  anything they see. Why would anyone shop with that type of person? Well, I really don't know. Women, in perticular, have the annoying habit of always having to touch everything they see. If it is something they like, they always have to try it on. We all know how it is when a woman tried on some clothes (usually several ) but it's still better than when we're talking about shoes! That has to be the worst. Seeing or imagining a woman in the cloths she chooses can at least help when  being bored, but shoes are just shoes. Shopping for them is a very long and tiring experiance. It seems to last forever and just when you think she's done, she spots an othe pair. Shopping for me is supposed to be a very fast experiance. As soon as someone else is with you, it can become horrible! ",31.0
594," Mrs/Miss Helen: Thank you very much for your letter. It is excellent to have won this prize. To be honest I had doubts about winning the competition, because in spite of I think I did well, I had to play against a very strong competence. The idea about going to California for 2 weeks make me feel very excited. According with your letter, July is the period of time  suits me best. My job is less demanding in July. About the accommodation I would prefer to stay in a tent. I have never done it before, so I really fancy the idea. I am really surprise about how many activities can be practised in this place. If  is possible I would like swimming. I am very good at swimming. On one hand I think that climbing sounds very exciting, but on the other hand it scares me a lot, so I will play tennis. I am not so bad at tennis but I would like to improve my style. By the way, I would like to know if the level of life in  USA is similar to  UK. How much money should I bring with me? Another point is about the clothes, could you confirm me that I'll need summer clothes? I would be very pleased . Please if you need further information from me, don't hesitate to contact me again. Yours sincerely.  [SEP]  Normally I enjoy really much shopping. In fact when I don't feel very happy I decide to do shopping to try to cher myself up. And really, it works. But not everything about shopping is enjoyable. For example, I hate  when I get into a shopping centre and it is crowded. I don't like  when I have to try on differents sizes because the small  doesn't fit on my body because I have got weight. It is in this moment when really I realiase I am getting fat and it is a horrible feeling. I think women, in general, are very impulsive  purchasing things. Many times we buy things that in fact, we don't need and, sometimes you  surprise when you check the balance of your bank account and then you need to cut down  your expenses for 2 months. But from another point of view, it is silly to be earning money and don't spend it as you want. At the end of the day money is just money. ",32.0
442," Mr. Manager: The porpouse of this letter is to complain about my experience with the musical show ""Over the Rainbow"", wich really disapointed me. First of all, there were no diccounts avaible  as it said on the anouncement so I had to pay the original price wich wasn't cheap at all. Then, I was forced to wait fourty five minutes to see the show because it started at 20:75 in stead of 19:30 and when it finally started, I was really disapointed to see that the actors weren't Danny and Tina as it said on the anouncement. Finally, when the show finished, I couldn't visit the theatre restaurant because it was closed for repairs. So, as you can see, it wasn't my perfect evening out at all that's why I demand you to send me my money back. Your really unsatisfied costomer  [SEP]  How has modern technology afected my daily life? Since the begining of human life, people have invented ways to make their life easier. That is not difference from now. We live sorrounded by inventions wich help as through the day. From the vehicle we use to move faster to the light bulb we use at night, we constantly depends on these inventions to be able to make the things we have to do.

314," Dear Sir or Madam I am writing with regards to the musical show 'Over the Rainbow' and I am going to complaining about it. I saw it last Friday and it was disappointing me because the actor was not the same man as  the advertisement ad I had expected to see him so I couldn't enjoy myself at all. Secondly, it didn't start at seven thirty. I don't know if there was some problems but I had to wait for forty-five minutes. I could not believe it! In addition to this, I could not get a cheaper ticket so I wonder why the advertisement mentioned about the reduction  tickets. Moreover, despite there were some restaurants in the theatre, they had already closed because it was too late, I wanted to have a coffee but I could not. I should not have gone to see the musical. I do not want to think you told a lie but I felt  to waste my time and money. I would like  to refund all the money and I recommend to thinking about the advertisement. I hope you understand me and the show is going to be succeeded. Thank you for your time and I am looking forward to hearing from you soon. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets and because of her nasty habit, I lost my best friend and boyfriend at the same time. She was one of my friends and I couldn't trust her at all because she was a truble maker. One year ago, I had a boyfriend and he was a perfect man for me. I was happy at that time and I met  with him almost every day. I believed that I  get married to him although my happiness didn't last. One day, Pat gave me a ring and she told me that my best friend was going out with my boyfriend in secret. I couldn't believe her because my best friend was a boy! I was too shocked to eat anything. I tried to avoid thinking about it but I couldn't. I dared to ask him and he told me his truth. It was true! I shouldn't have asked him! And then I asked him to split up with my best friend but to make matters worse, he chose my best friend! If I didn't hear from Pat anything, I could have got married  him. I couldn't do anything and two month later, my boyfriend got married to my best friend. I felt sad and miserable. ",37.0
178," Dear Madam/Sir, I'm writting to you to explain my problem that I have had in your theatre. I recentely had a week's holiday in London, and during my stay, I went in your theatre to see ""Over the Rainbow"" because I have seen an advertisement about this show and I was really interrested  to see it for many reasons, one of this reasons it is that I love the starring Danny Brook. And I would like that you know that I have had a very disappointing evening, due to the differences between the advertisement and the show that I saw. First of all, the actor was not Danny Brook. Secondly, in your advertisement the time of the show was 19:30 and in reallity the show has started at 20:15 and the discount was not available. Finally, I wanted to visit you theatre restaurant after the show but it was already closed. So, I had a very disappointing evening and it would be very kind of you if you give me back the money . I'am looking forward to hear  you as soon as possible. Your faithfully,  [SEP]  I think it is very good to have a science and technology because it can really affects our lives. For example 20 years ago, people who were affected by the AIDS Virus couldn't live more than two or three years, but now with the new science, there is several therapi and now people affected by this virus can live many years. I think you can do a lot  of think now than before with the techonology. You can travel around the world by train, by plane or by ship and maybe one day you can fly by car. Why not. I hope that you will find this composition interesting. best reguard. ",22.0
752," Dear Madam Ryan, I am very happy to have won the first prize in your competition. It is a wonderful surprise. I can go to the Camp California only in July, because I have school in June and I must work in my father's bookshop in August. At the Camp I want to live in a log cabin. I do not like the tents; one can find insects in them and they are not as comfortable as log cabins. For the two activities I can choose, I would like to play tennis: I have some experience in this sport, because I played tennis during seven years and it is still my favourite activity. I would try to do some painting, too, but I have never painted. I would like to know what sort of clothes I have to take (if it is going to  rainy or to be sunny) and how much money I must have with me. Could you tell me what sort of material I will have to bring to do the activities? Yours sincerely Odette Douai Luna  [SEP]  Dear Kim, Do you know last week I have been to a pop concert to help my uncle, who is the director of the stadium of Lugano. It was very interresting, because I did different things. I cooked a meal for the artists, I spoke with the manager of Bruce Springsteen and I helped a technician to install his material: the lights. The best part of the day was after the concert, when I met the group ""U2"". I was very excited, because this is my favourite group: I'm always hearing  their songs. I took some photographies and I'll show them to you when you come next week I had a talk with Santana, the best guitarist in the world, too. He's quite old, but very attractive. I would like playing guitar like him. What a great day it was. The next concert is on 19th June and I will be here. See you soon. Yours Odette ",32.0
1111," Dear Mr Robertson, Regarding the programme you have organised, it is  great ideas everything that you have planed, but I would like to suggest to you something that the students saw in an advertisement. It is  good start to go on  sightseeing by bus on Monday morning,  we can se all  famous buildings in a few hours. It's seems relaxing to go to Greenwich in the afternoon looking though the river. The idea about going to  science museum is fantastic, I read about the museum,  it is really interesting in science history. After all morning in the Museum, it is wonderful and on tuesday doing some shops, whereas the student have another idea for tuesday. On Wednesday after  viseted  national Art Gallery, we can have a chat about ours next holiday at the free time in the afternoon. The advertisement that  students saw is about a fashion show, but to go to the show you will need cancel the tour on tuesday and add the show, because the show is from 10.00 to 19.00. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Freedom! Nowadays the main attroction in the newspapers and  television is  private life of famous people. It is really interesting how people like knowing  famous people life. Without someone famous know, photographs take pictures secretly,  try to get money on it. Sometimes being famous can get stress,  everywhere they go there are people around them, especially journalists, trying to ask millions  questions. Famous people deserve to have freedom to do whatever they want, but it is quite difficult to do thing in a public places, because nobody like  famous politicians or film stars without asking questions. On the whole, to be rich and famous don't always bring happeness, whereas the majority of the population wish they were rich and famous. ",21.00
308," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to express my dissatisfaction about the show you presented two weeks ago at your theatre. As I was spending a week-end in London I took a chance too see the performance of one of my favourite actors, Danny Brook. Unfortunately as soon as I came to the theatre I was told that there had been a change in the cast and Danny Brook was not part of it anymore. Besides, since my girlfriend and I had really to hurry up to reach the theatre on time we hadn't had any dinner, as we had been thinking  to have it at your restaurant. You cannot imagine our disappointment when we realised that the show had been posticipated at 20.15 instead of 19.30 and that the restaurant was closed because of restructuring; as a matter of fact, after the show we only ate an hamburger in a fast-food . In conclusion, I would like to have the two tickets refunded considering also that there were no discounts available, as instead it was stated in the advertisement. Yours Faithfully  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. In fact this was the main cause of Mr White's resignation and suicide. Pat was not a very clever teen-ager and while she was attending the Secondary School she had many troubles with Chemistry. I could actually say that if it hadn't been for Mr. White she would have never passed her exam to enter University. Mr White came to our school when he was 40 year-old but still well-looking and all my girls school-mates fell suddenly in love with him; he was always so kind and generous towards his pupils that any girls felt herself loved by him: Pat certainly was one of them. One day while she was walking in Central Park she saw a man and a young girl sitting under a tree. Immediately she recognized her beloved teacher kissing one of her class mate and she run away as fast as she could. She was so angry and felt so betrayed by Mr White that without any exitation she went to the school Headmaster to report everything she had seen. The next day Mr White was charged for abuses and obliged to resign. The trial was long and had a wide coverage by  media. We live in a small and old fashioned town and Mr. White was considered a monster: loosing his job was hard for him, but even harder was the loss of his beloved pupils who were not allowed to meet him; so, on a bright summer day he took his final decision and died terrified by the darkness which was nearing.

503," Dear Sir or Madam I am writing to complain about the musical show ""over the rainbow"". I recently booked a week's holiday in London to see the musical ""over the rainbow"" the date was the 9th of June 2000. from your firm. It was said that Danny Brook should play the leading part, but there was a different actor instead. This made me really disappointed. We arrived at the theatre at 19,00 since the play should start at 19:30 but we had to wait until 20:15 then it started. It was also said that discounts was available but this was wrong, because we couldn't get any discounts. The theatre Restaurant that should be open after the show was closed because the chief was ill and there was no food in the fridge. This should have been our perfect evening out but it wasn't. I am not satisfied with this musical show at all. I am therefor writing to ask for a full refund I am expecting to receive a cheque for £20. Yours faithfully Anne Svensson  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. How should she manage to keep quiet about this. This was the best thing that ever had happend in years for the Fennall family. Pat's sister-in-law was having a baby but she wanted to wait and tell the rest of the family. She realised that telling Pat was a very bad idea but now it was done. Pat was so happy the whole day and wanted to tell her mother but Maria told her not to. Maria was still a little bit chocked over the naus of having a baby. She and her husband Peter had been trying for so long and now they had succeeded. Many weeks went by and Maria and Pat didn't say a word about it. The rest of the family understood that something was wrong because Pat started to buy baby clothes. Which was very chooking for her mother. One day when they all sat down at the kitchen table for having their lunch Pat said, - ""Maria and Peter are going to have a baby""! The End. ",26.0

I feel, it will be the best holiday, I have ever had. I look forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable Who does not like shopping? Perhaps  just men or anybody who has  lack of time or if you are looking for something to buy particular and  shop has not range of variety. Frankly, if I had a lot of money I would have spend my entire life to do shopping. Although I am the one who loves shopping, I can not stand on the Easters, the Christmas and Sundays, because those days are suitable for anyone to consume the food, buy some presents etc. However, everyone prefers to do the same thing and  the same time. it causes over crowded shops, high-pitch noise,  lack of parking place and if you have to go shopping with a child, the whole  matters just  enough to drive you crazy. Despite knowing the difficulty we do not resist to do shopping in those days. On the other hand, some companies offer special service such as sending your order with the post or  on  telephone. It could be the solution, avoid busy hours or days, do not bring your child with you, choose the right shop which has  park. ",27.0
958," 13 of June 2000 Dear Helen Ryan: I will be very happy to travel on july because in that date I am going to have my holidays, so I will not have to ask permition from my work. At the same time, on july is my birthday, so it would be nice to celebrated  there. I will prefer to have my accomodation in a tent, couse in that way I can feel more clouse to the nature, and I can remember when I was a scout girl. Sleeping in  tent is much more exiting and clousy than  a log cabin. At the camp I will like to choose two activities, Painting and Singing, I love painting, in the university I studied art for two years, but now I don't have much time to paint couse I work in a bank and I have a baby. So I will be very happy to improve my art in the camp. The reason of my option for singing is couse I feel embarrest about my voice, so maybe I could get it better. I will like to have more information about the prices of the clothes and souvenires. Thankeaw for givin me this oportunity.

971," Dear Madam I am writing to answer the informations that you need from me. First I would like to thank you for doing this competition and I would also like to thank you for the prize. Answering your questions, I would like to travel only en July because this is the month of my vacations. In July I will be free to travel anywhere I please. According to your letter I have two options of accommodation, or in tents or log cabins. I would prefer in tents because I think that is something more exciting and new for me. I never stayed in  tents in the middle of nowhere, in my life so I would prefer something more realistic and new. Log cabins may be more confortable, on the other hand I think that I will be able to ""survive"" in  tents. Looking to your letter, I can see many options of activities and I realized that I like most of them. I think I would prefer Climbing and Painting. The reason of choosing this two activities is that they contrast  itselves, I want one  more exciting and that asks for more agility and another  more calm and relaxing, that asks only for my ability to paint. Climbing is something new for me and I am not so good on that, however I wish that I can learn about it on the Camp. Painting is something that I love and I am very good doing it. I have some doubts about my prize and travel. Is there a possibility that you  send me a list of material and clothes that I have to take? Is all  the travel already paid  including food and meals, or  I have to bring some money? Do I have to bring something especial for the tents and camping? Please answer my letter as soon as is possible. Your faithfully, GUSTAV SOARES.  [SEP]  Dear Kim, How are you? Is everything good in  USA? I'm writing to you because I had a wonderful experience last month. There was a concert of a famous band here in my city. I vish you were here with me. So, I went with my friend to the concert with a lot of fans. We bought tickets to the show and also to the fan's bus. Yes, there is a bus that take you to the concert and bring you back. The concert was going to start at 22:00 and the bus arrived at my house at 18:00. When we entered inside of it, we saw a lot of fans using T-shirts, caps and shouting, ""Almendegos, Almendegos..."" (that is the name of the band). AT 20:00, we stopped in a coffee house to eat. The shouted: ""20:30 you all have to be back because the bus will leave."" We sat and started to eat and talk. Suddenly a man came and started to tell us his adventures. They were very interesting and we liked him so much. After a few minutes (I fought  were  few) I realized that the coffee house was empty. I looked to my watch: 20:45. The bus had left about fifteen minutes . The man offered  a ride. We accept. You can not imagine how dissapointed I were with my ownself. When we arrived the concert had already began. When we were running to enter a man called us. He was helping to put the materials of the concerts (microphone...) on the stage. He asked if we could help. We answered: ""Yes!"" We started to put everthing on the stage and after this we realized that the band was entering into the stage near us. By my side the vocal of the Almendegos was and he touched my arm. I will never wash my arm again. After all of this we saw the show in the best place, near of the stage and after, the thing that I most liked, we were convidated to see the group and had their signatures. That was the best night of my life. I wish that you liked my experience. Kisses, GUSTAV. ",27.0
74," Dear Mrs Jane Clark I'm writing to express my dissatisfaction with  International Arts Festival, which was organised by you last year. However I think that International Arts Festival is a great idea and I suggest you prepare it better. Firstly, it was written on the advertisment that there would be stars and artist from around the world I believe that it's difficult to arrange meetings with foreign stars but there were artist from only six countries and in my opinion there should be more. Secondly, the concerts took place in concert halls, which in my opinion were too small. That was the reason why some people were complaining. Thirdly, I suggest you should put more plays and films  next year, because watching them is a very nice way of spending our freetime. Fourthly, I have to admit that a big advantage was your idea about giving one reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events. That was excelent because it attracted peoples' attention Lastly, I'd like to give you a piece of advice. I suggest you invite some film stars, because they are very famous and people like them I hope you'll look into these matters and improve the festival next year. I look forward to hearing from you Yours sincerly  [SEP]  Nowadays everybody wants to earn money. Young people know that money make the world go round, so they always look for a job with  big salary. Some people say that the young shouldn't be independent and earn on their own, but I am sure that it's better to work in your free-time than waste it. In my opinion the young should work rather than wait for their pocket money. There are a lot of possibilities  to earn some money but of course the young are not able to get  well-paid job, because they are not enough experienced and educated. They have to think about some season jobs. Firstly, the good way to earn money is, to help the old. They often are not able to do  shopping or walk the dog. If you help them, they may give you some money as a reward. Secondly, you can find an easy job in a shopping centre. It's better paid and  permanent job. You can work in storage, look after the goods or catch shoplifters. If you are  good mathematic you can be a seller. Thirdly if you are good looking you can apply for a job in  restaurant and become  waiter. Maybe you'll not get a big salary but think about the tips, which in the posh restaurants are very high. Lastly, if you like playing instruments and you don't like working you can go busking. If you are  good musician you will get a lot of money. ",30.00

It was a great idea to organize such  festival. I am a teacher and I love music. Most of the events which I had seen were good. I enjoyed  dance shows,  jazz and rock concerts. I visited art exhibitions. There were a lot of nice pictures, sculptures and other creative works. I was impressed by them. At  festival I could talk with writers. It was an excellent idea to make one reasonaly-priced weekend ticket for all events. A lot of people could visit as many events as the they could. I was very surprised when I knew that  stars and artists were only from six countries. It was too little for this festival. It was  pitty that too small halls were used for  classical concerts. I like going to classical concerts but at this festival the sounds of  music were terrible. I have some suggestion for next year's festival. Firstly, it will be great if you invite more famous singers and bands. The second one is to include more musical films and plays. I would like to help you in your interesting job.

Re accommodation: I would like to stay in a log cabin. I have had sleeping and breathing problems in tents which were serious. I hope to avoid these this time.

I'm looking forward to your reply Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Dear Kim, Thank you for your letter. I'm glad to hear that you have found a job. I want to apologize for writing so late, but I had a lot of work to do. Do you remember the concert I helped at. It was absolutely amazing. My job was checking the entry tickets and the bags of the fans. We started at 7 am. to let them in the concert area. I had to tear off a part of every single ticket. This part had to be saved for later because the concert orginazer wanted to know the exactly number of visitors. After two hours of tearing tickets I changed my place and went to help at the security section. Here, I had to check the bags and couts of the girls. Fans weren't allowed to take any sharp things  with them, like knifes or scissors. So I looked into every bag and found some forbidden things in some of the bags. I really felt like a security guard. It was a great experience. I had a serious duty and also a lot of fun. I met new people which I still see. I would like to introduce them to you. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Love ",39.0

Every one think that shopping in the best way to carry off your problems and, in fact a big solution of many problem or estrés, boring, or only for distraction. But the question is: Why shopping is not always enjoyable?. For many people, shopping had always been only for one kind of elite, or social class; not all people can go shopping and buy hundreds and thousands of stuff in those big malls as  distraction. Let's talk about women; nightmare! women can't resist the fact of shopping and they are dissapointed when they don't have the wants to shop. The shopmania is really unstapped. I know women that make everything they can to buy only a dress, or even worst, women that buy things that was nothing to do with them, for example, snap, esculptures, kitchen tissues, or eveything on telemarketing that really are unuseful, but the fact of have it "" there"" they can  resist There are many facts to prove that shopping is not ""pretty and armonious"", but believe me,  is not always enjoyable.

740," Dear Helen Ryan. I'm so glad to hear I have won first prize in your competition - two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. Thank you for asking me  some details. I'd like to travel in July. Because I am a university student, I have got classes until the midle of June and I have to attend to a 'Development & Research Conference' at the end of June. Otherwise I have to work at a business department office as a assistant from the beginning of Aguest. So I will be able to travel in July. Accommodation is very important for me as well. I would prefer staying in log cabins. I've got some skin trouble and I can't sleep very well in tents. I have ever slept in tents when I went camping. That time I had to sleep in  tent. Whole night, I felt backache ands shoulder ache so I couldn't sleep very well. And I've never stayed in log cabins. It sounds wonderful! Could I have the chance to do two activities while I am at the Camp? I'd very much like to do painting and swimming. I am quite good at painting. Especially I love water-painting. I really want to paint the countryside of California. It will be  fantastic experience for me. Actually I can't swimming at all. I'm afraid of water. That  why I couldn't have swimmed yet. I think this chance is  very good for me to learn to swim. I expect to join  above two activities. I want to know how much money I need. You pay for all costs. But I think I'll need some money for clubing or evening events. And please let me know How the weather is. I'll buy some clothes, shoes and a hat. So I must know if it is cold or hot. I'm looking forward to hearing from you as soon as possible Your sincerely  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable. Whenever I walk in the street, I always want to go into the every shops. I always want to buy T-shirts, Jeans, Skirts, cosmetic, hairband, accessories, ring, earings, bracelet, shoes, hats, bags, fancy stationeries, interior stuffs and CD. But it is impossible to buy everything at the same time. I have to chose some of them and I have to give up buying most of them. Before I go out home, I make a plan. What  is I want to buy and I decide to buy some items. But when I stand at every shops, I can't stand my desire. If I have got enough money to buy something what I want to buy, I can buy them and it will be no problem. However, If I haven't got enough money, I will not be able to buy what I want and it will be  very big problem. I feel depressed. Shopping is not enjoyable any more. I'll think  why I'm so poor. But I can get over . I go window shopping. Insead of buying something, I buy some fresh food and Ice-cream. They make me happy and rich. I can try every  shoes, clothes, hats, accessories and jakect on. They are mine! Shopping is not always enjoyable. But if you think positive opinion about shopping, It will make you the happiest and the riches man in the world. ",26.0
925," Dear Sir or Madam, I am glad to hear that I have won first prize, two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. I would like to travel in July because I will have my off in July. I would rather stay in a log cabin than a tent. I think it would be more comfortable than a tent. I want to join swimming and tennis courses. I have been swimming from my  five years of age  until 1993  as a member of  school team. I am good at timing on swim. I am also good at playing tennis. I won a prize in a competition in 1999. I would like to ask about the money. Is everything free? Do I need to bring money for anything extra? but also I would like to learn about clothes. Do I need any special clothe? Will you provide it? and Do I have to pay for clothes? If you  reply  my letter until  28th of June I'll be pleased with it because I have to give information about my holiday dates to my company. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours Sincerely,  [SEP]  - SHOPPING - Who doesn't like shopping? Everybody likes  from a child to an old lady in  sixties but it is not always enjoyable. When you get home tired after spending all your morning and afternoon at shopping you'll want to go to bed because you were looking for only a suit during all day and you couldn't find the perfect one. The only thing is we need to know what kind of thing do we want to buy and where could we buy cheaper and more quality stuff. We have  few possibilities. We can look up a magazine or a booklet which deliver with  newspaper weekly. We can order a free book from big shops or companies monthly. We can also watch some special channels on the television. The easiest and latest way is the internet shops recently so you don't need to see long-face staffs in the shops. You won't wait in the quee. You don't need to go out to buy something. You can order everything on the computer. I think you won't be tired and bored   end of your shopping on the computer. Think about  that way for enjoyable shopping. ",29.0
1209," Dear Mrs Smith, Thank you for your letter. I will try my best to answer the questions. First of all, we have already booked the Five-Stars Hotel for your group. It is a modern hotel, near our college, and it is also very convenent to come from the airport. You can take both by buses or taxies. The nember 101 bus starts from the airport, than you can get off from  ""city college"" stop. It would be a great chance to tark part in the party for everyone. This is just a relaxing party, just for the members have a chance to relax and make friends. So I think you'd better to wear a dress. Finally, about the free three hours, my personal prefer  to go shopping. Our city has got the biggest shoping centre in South England, there gathers so many shops. It  worthes tp spend time and money on that. I look forward to seeing you! Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Nowdays people have become used to watching televesion's programs everyday. The TV is so important that you can see it in every family, and it is a essential equipment for everyone. First of al, in my opinion, TV has a great education functions, and  also makes the world become small. You can just sit at home then you can know what is happening all over the world at the moment. I would rather watching the news on TV in stead of reading in newspaper or hearing on  radio because the news on TV are vivid. Moreover, the TV is a great company for the people who live alone or feel alone. I would like to open  TV when I stay at home. Someone are talking, laughting, crying on there, so join them, you will feel much better than just yourself. Some TV programs are enjouable! However, TV also has some disadvantages. You might just sitting in front of  TV for hours learn nothing, or no more talk with your family. I think this is the badest influence in the society. In clucsion, the TV has both advantages and disagvangtages, but on the whole  advantages is greater than  disadvantages. So, but on the whole, TV still is a wonderful and important invention on the world. ",19.00
34," Dear Mrs Jane Clark, With regard to your International Arts Festival advertisment, I would like to share with you the pleasure I had to be part of the event and  some suggestions for next year's festival that you might take in consideration. The International Arts Festival is a beautiful idea. I enjoyed most of the events and I found your prices excellent considering that I am a student and that I do not have much money. In your advertisment you mentionned that there is artists and stars from all around the world coming, unfortunately I found out only six countries were represented. I would like to suggest that more countries should be part of the Festival if it is possible. It is a very good opportunity to listen to different kind of music and to discover different culture. Hoping that I did not offend you in any ways and that you might take in consideration my suggestion, I wish you all the best for next year's festival organisation. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  It's a story of a special person who was born in my country and who is now known worldwide. The night he came into this world, was one of grater even if for the habitants of the country or even of the town where he was born, it was a casual night. The sky was so clear that the moon and the stars were lighting up all the land. Only the one who knew how to read stars could actually tell that a great king was born. When the three men saw him they fell on their knees to worship him. The mother was pride because she knew he was sent from above and he was going to be the one to set people free from their sins. This little man from Israel died as the  hero of all times. His message is still as impacting today and will always be even if this story happened a long time ago. ",26.00
312," The Circle Theatre 17th Jun 2000 Dear Sir and Madam I am writing this letter to want you to know that what I think about the musical show which you (The Circle Theatre) present. I bought  group ticket for the show. Because we were 7 people. I saw ""discount available"" in the advertisement. When I asked something about  ""discount"", your staf said that it is impossible. I ignored it. Becouse I wanted to see this show. Becouse my favorite actor plays in it. We went to the theatre bulding at 18:30. We waited to start the show  about one hour and fourty-five minutes. The show started late ( about 45 min.) We were bored and we wished that this is  last mistake During the show, we couldn't see Danny Brook who is my favorite actor. An other one played in the show. We were really angry. Becouse you said  lie to us. If Danny Brook does not play, you have to say something about this to  people who there are in the theater This is your unforgiven mistake. After the show, w were still angry, we wanted to eat something in your theater restaurant. When we came to the restaurant, we saw that it was close. I was sure that we can visit it after the show  is writing on the advertisement. We were hungry and angry in this time. This is  too bad evening for us. We were bored to waiting. We couldn't see Danny Brook in the show. We were hungry after the show. But we couldn't eat something and we couldn't use  discount. They are your mistakes. I hope that you can understand me and you will do something about  mistakes. When you do something, I went to see your new shows. But, now, I want to ask that you could pay my money back. Thanks for reading this letter Yours faithfull  [SEP]  CHANGING LIFE When I went to school, I wrote a letter to my friends. Becouse I hadn't got a mobile-phone. Now I have got a mobile-phone and I always use it. It's fast and easy. But sometimes I miss the letters. I miss to wait  the postman every morning. Before we had a computer, I played game with my friends in our garden or in their garden. We played a lot of games during  day. When we had a computer, I started to play computer games. I didn't want to play outside games with my friends. Becouse the computer was more interesting than my friends. I use  internet now. I don't buy  newspaper. Becouse I can read my newspaper in the internet. I can buy something from  internet. for example, I send a flower to my mum in mother's day by internet order. My daily life is changing. Everthing is easy now. I can send a mail to my friend who lives in Canada. I never forget important days. Becouse I have got a data-bank. When the important day is coming, it says to me. Life is really easy. You need to learn how you can use the technology. But, sometimes I miss  past days. I miss to play in the garden, post a mail to my friends,  forget the important day. Sometimes I want to go to somewhere without technology. ",21.0
233," Dear sir, I'm writing to you, to complain about the musical show ""OVER THE RAINBOW"", that I came to see during my holiday in London, at your theatre. Unfortunately that evening wasn't as good as I expected. First of all in your advertisment for the show you wrote that Danny Brook and Tina Truelove were taking part at the show. And I was so excited about it! But I was very disappointed when I realised that another actor was taking  part. And the worst  was that he wasn't so good in his role! Another thing was that the show I went to was  starting at 19:30 but it started at 20:15! The people who were there to watch the show were very ungry and they were shouting because they  were waiting for too long, And I absolutely agree with them. Also in the advertisment you wrote that discounts were available, but they weren't, And also that people could visit the theatre restaurant after the show, to eat some thing or to have a drink. But when I went there, it was closed. I don't know why and I'd like you to tell me, the reason. Finally, you said that it would be our perfect evening out. Well it wasn't and I ask for my money back. I'd like you to return them to me. I'll wait to hear from you soon...  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. So, the next day Pat went and told to his sister Sally that her friends were organising a suprise party for her birthday. When Sally heared that,  was very suprised and very excited. But because she didn't want to disappoint her friends, she was acting as  she didn't know anything. She let them to organise it! But although she was acting like this she was very ungry with her brother Pat, because he didn't keep the secret. The party was on Saturday at Sally's house. All her friends were going to meet there, while she was at her swimming lesson. When that day arrived they all went there as they planned. When the clock showed 8:00 they hide themselves under the tables and the  furnitures. After a while the bell rang. It was Sally! Suddenly they all shouted ""suprise!"". Sally although she knew  it, she seemed very suprised! So her friends didn't understand that she knew about the party and they were very happy because they believed that the suprise party had   succeed! But although Sally knew about it, they had a really great time. They danced a lot and they had pizza for dinner. It was an unforgetable night!!! ",30.0
432," Dear Sir, I am writing to you because I have recently been at your musical show at the Circle Theatre but I'm sorry to say that I had a very disappointing evening. I was in London for a week's holiday and I decided to go to the theatre. I saw your musical show advertised in my hotel and I decided to buy a ticket. I am still a student and I saw in the advertisment that there were some discounts available. I asked for it but the answer I received was that there wasn't any kind of discount. I arrived at the theatre at 19.00 and I thought I'd have waited only thirty minutes. I waited more than one hour because the show started at 20.15. But, at the moment, I thought that these things can happen. When the musical show started I had the third bad surprise. The male actor wasn't Danny Brook but an actor that I've never seen before. At the end of the show I was very hungry and so I had the brilliant  to decide to go to the theatre restaurant but, of course, it was closed! I think that if there had been only one or two problems I wouldn't have written to reply but there had been only problems. I'd like not only to reply but also to have my money back because my evening wasn't ""perfect"" as you advertised but it was a big disaster. I am looking forward to hearing  you as soon as possible. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Every aspect of our daily life is influenced by technology. I'll give you some examples describing how technology affects my life every day. The first thing I do every day, when I get up, is to prepare  fantastic cappuccino with my coffe machine. Then I go to work by motorbike. The first thing I do when I arrive in my office is to switch on my computer. During all the day I speak with the majority of my collegues by telephone or e-mail. Sometime I stay alone all the day but I have contacts with many people. When I have to book a holiday, to buy a book or to control my bank account  use  Internet and I do all these things, and many others, without moving from my office. When I finish to work I come back home. If I haven't enough time to cook I prepare my meal using my fantastic microwave hoven. If I'm too tired to go out with my friends I finish my day looking a programme on television. I know that it can appear a sad day but it's what a lot of people do every day in every part of the world. To conclude, I think that technology has improved many aspects of our daily life. But it's also true that sometime we aren't able to make a step without it. ",33.0
405," Dear Sir of Madam, I am writing to complain about the musical show which was presented by The Circle Theatre last week. I saw the performance and it was not like it was mentioned in the advertisent I read in the local newspaper. First of all, the main actor was not Dany Brook as it was expected so. That was very disappointing. Secondly it must have started at 14.30 and ended by 19.30. However, it started at 20.15. I had to wait almost an hour. Then, I was planning to buy three £20 tickets because it was mention in the advertisement that there were dicounts available but that was not true, so I just could buy two tickets and my son could not see the show. Finally, I was thinking  to have dinner in the threatre restaurant after the show but it was closed due to some problems with the employees. What was suposed to be a perfect and enjoyable evening, resulted in a very disappointing time. So I would be greatful if you payed for a full refund of the money I spent in the tickets. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Computers, radio, CD's, sattelite television and a lot of other things have changed my daily life. Modern technology affects the way things are done and many aspects in my life, and it has some advantages as  some disadvantages. On the one hand, technology is a great help for me at school. What I mean is that computers are very useful  to do my homework (like some monographies or researching). And I can't even think about how it would be  not having a computer. Another advatage is that, for example sattelite television, which is an example of modern technology, makes me be informed about what is happening on the whole world. On the other hand, I have to admit that technology makes things so easy that when I have to do them without it I find it very difficult. The best example is the homework I have to do for school, I can't manage to do it when I don't have my computer to help. In addition to that, technology doesn't sometimes let me develop my imagination and creative skills. My mother says that I'm always playing with my computer or watching T.V. instead of reading or doing some more interesting activities. To sump up, I can't think about how my life would be  without technology. ",30.0
1214," Dear Mrs. Maria Smith. I got your letter this morning and I am very pleased to give you some information. As I know, he booked the Palace Hotel in  downtown . When you go to the conference, you can take a bus or a taxi. But if you have enough time, I would like to recommend to walk. Because there are a lot of beatiful trees and you can see the sea. And also it takes just fifteen minutes. I think everybody can enjoy it. By the way the end-of-conference party is a kind of fairwell party. There will be three parts. The first part, the chairman and a few guests will have a speech and the second part, the participacients will evaluate themselves, and the the last part it will provide dinner and drinks. It will be not too formal  party. So you can wear what you like. Moreover, I would like to recommend  'City tour' for three hours. Everybody an enjoy themselves. It is £12 each and there is a reduction for groups. I hope it will be a good tip for you and if you have any problem, you can contact with me any time. And have a nice time in my town and send my regard to Richard. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Nowadays there are a lot of inventions around the world, and they make us more comfortable and  convenient. Moreover we can not live without them. For example: electricity,  computer, telephon, boat, and car (wheel), etc. None of them are unimportant for us. But I think the invention of electricity is the most important thing among them. If you look around at home, there are a lot of electric things. Electricity could be able to invent other things. It also gave us more free time, especially for women. It has abosolutly reduced women's our house working time. Evenmore we can enjoy our night with lights. If we want do something, we can do it at night  same as   day. Finally the quality of our life is changed by electricity. It could reduce our working time and make us enjoyable. It is also advancing more and more. It will give us  better future! Have you ever imagined that you would drive  electric car! ",25.00
618," Dear Ms Ryan I'm very much surprised to receive your letter announcing the  first prize in your competition and I'm looking forward to spend the two weeks at Camp California. Just because I'm studying at the moment and I won't have my holidays till July. This is the month that best suits me. The second week of July would be perfect to start my trip. I would rather sleep in a log cabin. I find it will be much more comfortable than a tent. The leisure activities sound fantastic especially climbing and photography. I'm very keen on climbing. I've joined a climbing group in my town  2 years  and  reached the top of several middle-high mountains. The other activity I would like to try is photography. I have no previous experience on it but I wish I'd learn a lot. However, there are some questions that I want to ask you about. Do I need  passport to travel? What kind of clothes would be appropriate, winter or summer? Are there any food service at the camp? I hope to hear from you soon. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  This is a report to plan and suggest ideas for the daily life video at school. The activities suggested are write below. The opening time recording the students while they meet outside the school and come in could be a good begining. It would reflect the atmosphere when they meet early in the morning. Filming lessons such as grammar lessons and speaking either theory lessons or practice would give a general idea about a day at school and how students work on their lessons. Why don't  include some sports, for example, voleyball? The team has been training very hard during  last weeks. And they'll certainly feel very proud of being at the video. The musical lessons and the singing club in the afternoon are very popular among the students of all courses. Practically the whole school would appear on the video. I think that if we mix lessons with sport activities the combination will give us complete success. ",32.0
444," Dear Sir, Madam, I am writing to complan about your service. Last Sunday I went to the Circle Theatre. I watched a musical show which  called 'Over the Rainbow'. I was very disappointed  it. Because there were other actors  which played too badly. I don't understand why you changed them. I hoped to see Danny Brook and Tina Truelove as was presented in an advertisement. You had to start the show at 19.30 p.m. but you started too late at 20.15 p.m withour any ecxpenetion to people. Why did you put into the advertisement 'Discounts Available'? It wasen't!!! Any kinds of tickets were  original prase. After the show many people wanted go to your theatre restaurant, but it was closed because there someone has fixed something. I had the very disappointing evening so I would like to ask for return my money . I got the ticket for £20. I am hearing to looking fermards from you. Yours faithfully, Ilya V.

Pat gave same advise for me and I disayded to have an operetion. In a week time my classmates and teachers started to toking from me. I understand who told my secret to everyone.

326," Dear Mr Smith, I went to London last week for business and loving very much theatre I had promised my friend to offer her, after work, a very good evening with your musical show: ""Over the Rainbow"". I had read about it that was a very enjoyable show! What a surprise! Your advertisement was a quite lie and I have to tell you  my disappointment. Every point were wrong. (I wondered if it was a fake!) At first, from your advert  Danny Brook (who is a very good singer I appreciate very much)  was not here. An unknown man was singing, not in tone - awful for my ears - (poor Tina Truelove! such a professional singer with a beginner!) At second, to go on with the beginning, your show started not at 19.30 but nearly one hour later (20.15 to be more precise!) And for the third point, I would hope to offer a good diner to my friend because I knew your restaurant as a famous place but I was still disappointed. It was closed for some improvements! I hope you will understand  my evening was detestable and you will give me back my money. I join  this letter my two tickets. I am looking forward to hearing from you Best wishes  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets! Poor of I, I thought it was nice to have a friend and to be able to share lots of things! I was very young when this story happened but though it was a child's adventure I remember it yet. I was just thirteen years old! I had read a very good book about pirates and I know I got a very creative imagination. To make to profit my ideas my parents lived in a small village near a wonderful country. Like my heros I would like to live in a ship and decided to build something in a tree. The highest tree near a river I have ever seen. Peaceful place and wonderful view. With my friend Pat (I put him in the confidence) I started to work and my idea became real. It was our fortress and every day we could improve it. The tree was our ship and the river the sea. We could play  hours and hours without seeing an adult or  other children from the village. I prefered it. It was our secret Pat and I. Child's secret. But Pat could not keep it too long. He had a fault: he talked a lot and told an other friend our story. What a catestrophee! All  children went from the village and wanted to play with us. I accepted them but I was very angry against Pat. Our quietness disappeared and very fast everybody wanted to command my ship. A desaster! There was lots of fights between us and we were naughty like child could be with other child. The result was my ship was destroyed and never more I could trust in any friend! ",23.0

THEN, WE MOVED INSIDE THE THEATRE AND WE HAD TO WAIT 45 MINUTES UNTIL THE SHOW BEGAN!!, WHILE WE WERE WAITING, WE THOUGHT WE COULD GO TO THE RESTAURANT AFTER THE EVENT, AND THEN, WE REALIZED IT WAS CLOSED. BY THE TIME THE SHOW STARTED, WE WERE SO ANGRY THAT THE ONLY THING I REMEMBER IS THAT DANNY BROOK WASN'T ACTING.

117," JUN 17th, 2000 Dear MR SMITH, My name is Volencia Vardez. I am writing to complain about the services that you are offering during the shows at your theatre. Last May, I had a week holiday in London, and during my trip I decided to buy tickets for OVER THE RAINBOW, the MUSICAL SHOW. I was really excited with the idea of seeing that show. First of all, when I arrived, I met a note stuck on the front door that informed  about changes at  actor's staff. Danny Brook was ill. He was replaced by another actor whose abilities were bad. Secondly, I want to tell you that the show started forty five minutes later. In order to the tickets, I want to say that they are very expensive. I had put some money aside for a month, thinking about the discount, but when I want to buy them they said that discounts were not avaible. To sum up, the restaurant was closed. I will appreciate  if you could send me my money back. Looking for your repley. Yours Faithfully.  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat was not very good at keeping secrets. That is why she could no be a spy. When she was a girl, Pat used to play spies and detectives games. Her mother gave  a book about how to become a spy for her birthday. She had watched all  Mission Impossible and gadget, the inspector series. When she finished the school, she went to study to the Agent Trainning Agency where she learnt about guns, clues, agencies, etc. She was the best student they have ever had. But things changed during her first mission. She was sended to New York to discover how some people from  government gave money to the merchants because they want to build a Trade Center there. At first she walked around the bayside market looking for all the people who were there. When she saw a man, different for the rest, talking with one of the sellers. Immediately she interrupted and told to the man that she was a secret agent. Obviously the man realised that she was looking for him and said that she was really crazy! You can imagine what had happened with her cover as a spy. ",26.0

I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF THERE IS ANY CHANCE OF CHANGING THE PROGRAMME BECAUSE WE HAVE FOUND A VERY INTERESTING ACTIVITY TO DO ON TUESDAY 14 MARCH.

472," Dear Sir or Madam! I'm writing to you because of the musical show ""Over the rainbow"", wich I visited on Friday the 16th of June in your theatre. There are several points I have to complain  wich made the evening  not nice at all. At first the show started much later than it was written out. Instead of half past seven the show startet at quarter past eight. I couldn't go to have a refreshment because of two reasons, the first one is that there was no information  how much time the start of the show is going to be late . The second reason is that the restaurant of the theatre was closed because of building plans for the next two month. After I waited for about 45 minutes the show suddenly started but I had to realize that the main actor Danny Brook, who was the reason why I went into the show had been traded by an other actor, who couldn't sing as half as good then Brook. On your ticket information is written out that discounts are available, when I ask at the ticket reception I couldn't get any discount for beeng  student. To make an result the evening in your theatre and the show was very disappointing and not like  promised. For these reasons I want to ask you to get my money of £25 back. reasently Miss. Winkler  [SEP]  What is the prize? Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. He didn't want to say what Sarah just had told him, it just came over  his mouth, when he talked to James. ""Sarah has won in a quiz show?"" James was more than just interested, he wanted to know what she had won. But Pat made a promise not to tell anybody about the quiz show and he already had told enough. After one hour the hohle class had heard about Sarah's secret. Everybody was interested in what she had won but knowbody wanted to ask Sarah because it was told in a secret to them. Sarah realized that everybody was nice and friendly to her but something was going on in the class, when she turned around a talking and wispering started. Suddenly, she went to Pat and asked him did you tell anybody about our secret. Pat told her everything. Sarah looked at him for a while, than she stood in front of the class and explaind to the others, that she won a prize for 20 people to travel for 1 week to the sea of southern France and everybody of the 19 pupils was invited, except Pat who wasn't very good at keeping secrets.

72," Dear Jane Clark, I am writing to thank you for providing  International Arts Festival. It was  absolutely great idea. However, I would like to give some suggestions for next year as I have read the advertisement. Firstly, could you invite stars and artists from more than only six contries? In my opinion, it might be better to have time with  variety  nationallites. Secondly, the music concerts were very exciting and  had a lot of fun, but some concert halls were too small to enjoy them comfortably. Thirdly, I am expecting to watch more films and plays which were impressive. Lastly, it could be nice to students who are interested in  arts, if you help special events, for instance,  song contest, writing competition or dance lessons. To sum up, I hope the festival is developed next year with excellent reasonably-priced ticket like this year's. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  PART TIME JOBS : Find in your place Do you need money? If you do, make sure why you want to earn money. That is very important to find a way for earning and saving money. Probably the best way you can get money is to have a part time job in your spare time. I am recommending you to check your possible time to work - weekdays or weekend? - before you request a job. If you just decide to work, you'd better to find a job in your place. Firstly, go to your school or local council. They will be able to help to find safe and suitable jobs for students like you. Secondly, as your family or friends. As they know about your interestings and personality, it is easy to help you. In my case, I could get a telephone researcher part by my friend's reference. In conclusion, don't forget that a job is just spent in your ""spare"" time. That's it! ",26.00
552," Dear Mrs. Ryan, Thank you for your letter letting me know that I've won first prize in your competition. It came as a nice surprise. I would like to let you know that I can only travel in July because that is the only time I can take leave from work. I would prefer to stay in the log cabins as I would be afraid of insects or any crawling animals if I have to stay in the tent. For activities choices, I would like to choose Tennis and swimming. I used to play Tennis at tournament level and now I play it for enjoyment instead. Swimming is my best way of excercise and keeping fit. I've a few questions to ask. Since all accommodation and travel costs are paid for, Are there any other expenses that I have to pay? How much money I should have with me in order to cover all other expenses? Furthermore, what type of clothes I should bring? I would be grateful if you could let me know the above information as soon as possible. Thank you once again for giving me  good news! Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  I find shopping is the most time consuming. If I want to buy a nice pair of shoe, I'll have to go into a city centre and browse around from shops to shops until I find the shoes I like. If I'm not lucky enough to find one, then I'll have to take a train trip to a larger shopping places such as London. Whilst in London; I'll be facing crowds and people will be rushing everywhere. To walk around London streets looking for a pair of shoe can definitely be a tiring task. As I'm a compulsive buyer, I'd probably ended up buying other things as well. At the end of the day, I would not only be carrying  pile of shopping bags but also trying to squeeze in between other passengers on the train on my way home. By the time I get home, I would be completely exhausted. As you can see, shopping is not always enjoyable. ",33.0
775," Dear Sir, I was very happy when your letter arrived, yesterday. This trip will be very important for me, that is why I am interested in travelling to  U.S.A as soon as possible. I would like to travel on July because I will be on  winter holidays, so I will not miss classes at school. I would really prefer to stay in  tents because I love sleeping outdoors and listening   noises from outside. I am going to tell you two activities that I would like to do while I will be at the Camp. Firstly I would be happy if you let me play tennis, because I have played it for four years and I do it well, and secondly I believe that singing could be interesting because I really like it and I have a beautiful voice. I was wondering  the kind of clothes that I will have to wear and finally could you tell me how much money I will have to take? I look for ward to receiving more news. Yours Faithfully, Rosario de los Peines (Mrs).  [SEP]  Dear Kim, Hello! How are you? I'm writing because I know that you're interested in listening  my experience in which I enjoyed helping at a pop concert last month, perhaps in the future you'll be able to help too. If you want to help at a pop concert you'll have to write down yourself in a competition as I did, then, if you win the organiser will phone you and you'll be able to help them. At the concert I had to clear and organized all the people who were in, but at the end of the night I was able to talk with one of my favourite pop singer. I think that it was the experience I particularly liked most and which I will never forget. Looking forward to hearing from you. Love, ",26.0
65," Dear Ms. Jane Clark, I am writing to give my opinion about the International Arts Festival which was held  21st and 22nd November. I went to the rock concert by U2 and  the Chinese film ""Chung King Express"". Both of them were not only really enjoyable, but also reasonably-priced. However, I feel that it would be even better if there were some improvement. First of all, it would be greater if there were more famous people who have various nationalities. Because most of them were from English speaking country this year. In addition, larger halls should be provided for concerts since a lot of people could not get tickets for those by big stars. Moreover, personally, I hope that the number of plays and films will increase. I think they are the nearest 'arts' in real life. I would be glad if you consider my suggestions. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Money - hasn't it always been one of the most important problem for students? Of course, you can't afford a luxualy car and a large apartment unless you've born with a silver spoon. However, there are some good ways for you to earn enough money to enjoy yourself. How about working as a waiter or waitress? Not only it's a simple job, but also you can enjoy working with many colleague at your age. It would be great fan to make friends outside your class or club. If you say that the wage is far from satisfaction, why don't you teach younger students as a private teacher. It's also  really popular job among university students because of the good salaly. If you are interested in teaching and responsible enough, you'll probably become an excellent teacher. Stop complaining about  lack of money and let's start working to have a new world. You'll find that your life is becoming more and more enjoyable! ",24.00
890," Dear Helen Ryan, I am writing to ask for some queries about your letter which I have received. Firstly, I would like to travel  Camp California on Monday, 6th July, because my school's holiday will begin at the end of June. Otherwise I will not be able to join that camp. Secondly, could you make an arrangement for me to stay in a log cabin, because it seems that living in log cabins is more exciting than in tents. Also I would prefer to go swimming and surfing, because I used to be an assistant in a Korean national pool so that I am good at swimming. However, I have never tried to go surfing. That is why I would like to do that. Finally, could you tell me if I have to bring some clothes, towels and extra money? I would be appreciated it if you supply some towers, if possible. Thanks for your attention. I really look forward to receiving your reply soon. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Kim, It seems ages since I wrote to you. How have you been? How's your new flat? When I received your letter with photographs of that flat, it really looked nice. Anyway, I'll tell you about my wonderful experience which I enjoyed at a pop concert. It took place in a Korea national center which was the biggest building in Korea. There were a lot of people, I guess over 50,000, who wanted to see famous singers and listen to their songs. I helped to guide foreginers who would like to take participated in that. You know, I have studied English for two years in England. That's why I could attend to that concert as a volunteer, because they needed people who could speak English very well. What I really enjoyed was meeting famous World singers such as Madona, Bon Jovi, Ena and so on. I got Madona's signature! Can you believe it? I'll show you that and some pictures. I really hope to see you soon. Best wishes, ",28.0

I am very pleasant to know you decided to come to the ""II International conference of Human Rights"" which will be celebrated in Albert Hall college  next 25 of June. I would like to inform you that the group you belong to, has been booked in  Palace Hotel, in the center of London from the 24  June until  25 of June. The Albert Hall College, the building where will be taken part the conference is sited near Green Park Avenue; so, to get  it from the Palace Hotel you can take the bus number 26, otherwise, you can take the Picadilly Line from South Kensigton Station to green Park station. It takes about 10 minutes. Therefore, that's the faster way of transport you can choose. The Conference will start at 9 am of 25 June and will finish about 6 pm in the same day. During the day  is supposed having a break of half and hour at 12 p.m and finally,  a party for all the people who will be there. That will be a smart party and because of this, it will be required a well-dressed and immaculate presence. Ladies should wear an evening dress and gentlman a dark suit. As I can see from your letter, you will have about three hours before you catch your plane, so, I would suggest  to visit The Tate Modern Museum, where you will can find several interesting pictures such as Dali's  Warhols. If you need some more information or details about he conference, you can contact Alexia on 0033*** phone. I look forward to hearing from you.  Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Introduction The aim of this report is giving some suggestions to a group of American students who has just arrived in Rome and want some information about an interesting building to visit. Rome is a big city where they can find several moments and important buildings, for this reason I would suggest them to visit 1) ""Fontana di Trevi"" sited in Trevis Square in the center of Rome. That's a small square where there is a fountain very big. It was built by  Canovas architect in 1638. That is the fountain  which  ""Dolce Vita"" film was taken place. 2) For other hand, there is  Villa Borghese Building, That is a museum where they can find the most important sculptures and pictures of Antonio Canovas and, Bernini, who stayed for a long time working in Rome. CONCLUSION I would recommend  them the buildings because: 1) First of all, there are sited in the center of Rome so, they can take a bus to get  them move and around the city. 2) Secondly, they can enjoy visiting museums, and afterwards they can take something to eat or to drink in the ""pizzerias' and restaurants near these famous places. In conclusion, they could combine art, the history and the night  visiting one only place  without spend much money. ",28.00
953," Dear Miss/Mrs. Ryan, I have just received the excellent news about the prize I have won and I am writing to you in order to give you all the details you need. Firstly, I can only travel in July, as it is then when I get my holiday from my present job. Secondly, I would rather stay in a tent, because when I was a child I used to go to a campsite and stay in a tent with my family for two weeks every summer and I thoroughly enjoyed it. About the activities I can choose from, I would be delighted if I could sing, because it is something that I have always loved and, although perhaps I should not say that myself, I think I have a nice voice. I am also very fond of photography, so when I have seen that it is among your options it has been a wonderful surprise. Finally, I would like to ask you which kind of clothes are more suitable for that time of the year at the camp, the amount of money that more or less I would need to bring with me and if there is any cooking equipment to cook the meals ourselves. I am looking forward to receiving your prompt reply. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Kim, Thanks very much for your last letter. Because I could see how anxious you are to know about my experience at the Radiohead concert last month, I'll tell you something: it was fantastic. I friend of mine had been helping at a few concerts before, so that time the agency rang him and asked him if he could bring someone else, because they'd run out of stuff. He asked to me to go and when he told me the group was Radiohead I felt  the luckiest person in the world (you know I've always been an enthusiastic fan of them, so you can imagine how excited I was). I couldn't wait for it. When we arrived there we had to prepare the stage, clean everything and put a number on each seat. But the most amazing thing happened later, when ten minutes before the concert began, my friend told me we could see it from the backside of the stage. For a while I thought it was a dream. The playing was excellent, the public enjoyed it very much but, above all, I was there, at ten metres from my favourite group. I even got a few friendly words from the singer in a piece of paper: I hope you've enjoyed it. And his signature. I'll always keep it like a treasure. I'll show you the photographs I took next time you come to visit me, O.K? Till then, take care  yourself. Love, ",36.0

Last week my son and I went to see Over the rainbow at the Circle theatre. We paid to see Danny Brook, my son's favorite actor, but we seems quite disappointing, my son was very happy because he would see for the first time his favorite actor. However it's just the begining of the problems we had. Expecting the britan pontuality we went to the theatre at 19:00 to wath the 19:30 section but it only starts at 20:15, it finished later than it was suposed to and then we missed the train. I haven't seen any discounts available, I though my son would payed less than I. As we had alredy missed the first  we went at the theatre restaurant that is famous for the good food, however it was closed. In spite of this,  less you can do for us is to give  my money back and work hard so that this theater that is famouis about its beauty and pontuality don't become famous about it desorganized shows. Thanks,  [SEP]  People have seen in the last 10 years how diferent our clothes had become to.

170," London, June 17th Dear Sir, I'm writing to you to make  complaints for the very disappointing evening I had at the Circle Theatre. Firstly, I found that there were no discounts as it was announced in the advertisement. Then, I not only had to wait 45 minutes more than it was expected for the beginning of the show but I realised that the main actor had been replaced by another one (very bad) as well. Of course I must tell you that the strongest reason for my going to see the show was Danny Brook's presence. Finally, after the show, I went to the theatre restaurant just to find that it was closed and the friend I had asked to meet me there was not waiting for me. As if that was not enough he thought I had been kidding, inviting him to a closed restaurant where I didn't appear. Those were the reasons for my asking  a refund of the £20 I paid. I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon. yours faithfully  [SEP]  Every day we find out new devices that promise us to satisfy our needs. I usually don't buy a lot of them but I must recognise that some of them are useful. I can't remember waking up with the alarm-clock, making a hand-made orange juice or heating water for the coffee. Therefore, I have more spare time to enjoy the one  I consider as the most important influence technology had in my life: the computer and Internet. The improvement of electronics and global communications has made it possible to know places, look for information or even keep  close contact with friends all over the world. Now, I will never say again that I don't know where can I find some information about this or that and when on holidays or every time I make a new friend, I just ask for the email  and that's enough to know we will know about each other soon.

First of all, I'd like to travel only in July because I'm supposed to be a volunteer in the Music festival, held in August. Additionally, I'd rather stay in tents as I've never slept in tents before. Therefore it'll be a great experience for me. I'd like to choose swimming and photography as activities. I go swimming three times a week so I have no problem with swimming. I'm also the member of  photography club at my university and really keen on taking a picture of nature.

And you can take the Bus in front of the hotel to go to the College. It is four bus stops . Then walk straight for five minutes, you will see the college. After the party, we will go to an entertainment area to have fun and we will eat in Mc'Donalds. The rest you already knows. I suggest to wear shirts and jeans. And the last three hours before you return, we can go to the ""Imax"" cinema to watch a 3-D film! After we eat in the KFC. Then we all take you and the students to the airport. That's all. I wait you. Your sincerly  [SEP]  Madrid is a big city and have many interesting places. But the best place for me is ""La Vaguada"". An entertainment and commercial building. In there, students can have fun in the recreation areas, can watch a film and eat all kind of food and have shopping. We can have fun as well. And that's why I recommend this place to you. The building itself is a large building. It is very safe as there are policemen and cameras. The buildings seems to be very new but it is quite old. People love this place and called it ""Madrid-two"". Around it, there are many restaurants and shops as the building bring a lot of people. Inside, there are fast-food restaurants and shops as well.

10," Dear Mr. Clark, I'm a italian student who has come to the last International Arts Festival. I think this festival is a great idea because it's a possibility to see and to love the art, but, I think also there are some things thas could be changed. I noticed that the artists were from only six countries insted that from around the world. This choice doesn't give many artists the possibility to expresse themself. Some concert halls were too small and often people couldn't see the performances. There were many events that I think there were a few plays and films. Maybe it would be better put more of them in the programme because they like so much to young people. The very about young people, the choice to offer a reasonably-priced weekend ticket is a excellent idea because it brings them to have a contact with all what it art. I hope that my opinion can help you to set fro the next year a great internation arts festival alone to young people. Thank you and greetings.  [SEP]  I think a good way to get money it's work in a fast-food . Maybe the first impression isn't positive but from my personal experience, I can say that this kind of job is right for get some money. For six months I've worked in a McDonald's restaurant in Italy and I've got lots of money. I worked eight hours every day but in every fast-food  you can work part-time, four, three, six hours every day. It depends on what you need. This kind of job is perfect for the young people who want get money and in the meantime they have to study. If you work in a fast-food  you can work in the afternoon, or during the night and so you have time for yourself. In the staff you can also find young people and getting fun with them during the work. What do you want more? If you need money and you need time for yourself try a job like that. ",28.00

Thank you for organising this good programme, especially the Leisure show, which  very interest  us. So all of our class would like to go to the show during the three days in London. But there is a problem which I hope you can solve. According to your advertisement, we were pleased to learn that we can do some different activities in London, which included in sightseeing by bus,  River trip to Greenwich,  Science Museum and National Art Gallery  so on. The point is, The London Fashion and Leisure show will be fantastic. From these we can see the latest fashion, imagintive make up and hairstyles. What is more they are the Leisure and sports wear, which we are keen on seeing it. In your advertisement, you had written ""The show will be help in  Central Exhibition hall in London, it starts from 10 am to 7 pm on 14th March. I think it is a great opportunity because I am sure we will enjoy ourselves. But I wonder if the timetable could change, which will be perfect. As you know, all of us want to join the programme, so if some students go to  Science Museum, they will miss the wonderful show. For that reason, I suggest that you could change the activities. In my opinion, we had better go to  show instead of  science museum and shopping, also we can go to  Science Museum on 15th March, which instead of the free time in the afternoon. I am sorry to make your inconveint. I hope it doesn't make some trouble if you accept my suggestion. I look forward to receiving your apply as soon as possible. your sincerely,  [SEP]  It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. Because..... Last night, when I went into my house it was quite scilence. I felt there might be something  has gone wrong. I found my parents sitting in a armchair. I could see sadness in my father's eyes. My mother came over to me and said softly, ; my dear, your father's company has jut gone bankrupt', then she couldn't help crying. When I hear this bad news, I was very depressed because father worked quite hard for his company. My father always remembered his responsibily was giving  good salary to his worker, which is the view of his life. So I must find out a solution which can help my great father. One day, I suddenly got a good idea. 'Why not go to  sock exchange?' I said to myself. Almost every day I stayed in there and research the exchange decline-line, which give me lots of information from there. Finally, I decide to join  the dangerous game, which will lost everything or suddenly become  millionaire. With luck, I was won by chance. When I with mixed mood went home I found my parents were stooding at the door looked like very cheerful. 'Surely it doesn't mean that they have learnt the exciting news?' I said to myself again. Much to my surprise, they told me in high voice that they never went bankrupt, they wanted to give me a opportunity to do something impressive by myself. Now, they are both prouding of me! ",17.00

Firstly, since I'll be very busy during the next three months due to my job's demands, I would like to travel in July. Although the weather may not be friendly, it is the only time I have to see the beauty of the camp. I'll choose to stay in  tents, considering that I want to feel the country in a more raw way. And being a photographer during my spare time and a swimmer since I was a child, these will be the activities I'll like to do while at the camp - I think I am fairly good at doing both things! I would also like to know some more details about what sort of clothes I will have to bring with me and about the amount of money which  will be necessary for me to take. I'm looking forward to joining you in July and hoping for this trip to be an amazing experience. Yours sincerely Pablo Picasso  [SEP]  Shopping can be painful As a child, I would be taken to the mall and be forced to go through all the shops and establishments just to please my mother, whose desire to buy, without any sort of control, all kinds of clothes and gadgets was something unbelievable. And due to these bizarre situations I went through as a little boy, everything related to shopping seems like a bitter liquid which I'm forced to drink. It is difficult to see any enjoyment in shopping: facing the crowd, having to withstand the rude clerks and shop managers, trying desperately to choose the right thing - these burdens form the dark side of shopping. Certainly, buying things can be a pleasant activity, especially if you are acquiring the goods for yourself. But situations in which you do not need to move carefully in order to avoid stepping on someone's feet are quite rare and, when they do happen, time passes by very fast. However, if you are another fool standing amidst the crowd, waiting for the queue to move, time slowly melts. Believe me, shopping can also be painful. Your feet will turn into pancakes after a long day out in the streets and your muscles can get seriously injured after carrying all those bags which contain loads of objects. Amazingly, doctors tell people to look after their bodies during Christmas time: shopping can cause you a large variety of undesireble pains. Nonetheless, people still find some obscure pleasure in putting their mental health at stake. They keep claiming that there's no such thing as shopping. In spite of our decadence, some cheap souls still have the courage to say that, by shopping, they're filling their empty spaces. ",36.0
1067," Dear Mr Robertson I am writing to you about the trip to London. All of the students in my class have read through the programmes that you have set, they are quite interesting, especially the river trip to Greenwich, because some of us may go to the university there next year. So we can walk around and see how it looks like in Greenwich. All of us want to go to this trip, but some of my classmates saw an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show, and we all would like to go there. It is from 10 am to 7 p.m., it is about the latest fashion, leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles, all of us are really interesting, and it is free for student to get in as well. It is a really good opportunity to go because most of us are studying fashion design, and we can learn loads of things in there. So may you please change the visit of the Science Museum to Wednesday afternoon, and we can cancel our shopping and free time, so we can go to the fashion show on Tuesday. Yours Faithfully.  [SEP]  It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. It was two years ago, me and my classmates went to a leadership trip in London. This trip was organised by our form tutor, he wanted to test us if we trust each other and worked in a team, and the trip last for 3 days. The first days was going fine, we just had to do some teamwork things. In the second day, we had to climb up a twenty metres hill with our hands. It was so difficult for me because I was really scared to stand in a high place since I was young. I did not want to climb up but I did not have any choice. So I started to climb really slow and careful, and I climbed about 15 metres quite success, so I tried to climb quicker because the destination was not far away. But after I climbed two steps more, my right feet slipped over, I was nearly fell down, but luckly my hand caught a rock, it was dangerous, but I didn't had any choice, finally I did it. ",31.00
997," Dear Mrs Ryan, Thank you very much for your letter informing me that I have won the competition and that I have got a prize for a two week holiday at Camp California in the USA. Due to my business, I am very busy and that it is the best moment for my business so, I can't manage my time to go on holiday but I'd be able to travel at anytime in July. I would prefer to stay in a tent as I feel that it would be more exciting than staying in a log cabin. As you offered me two activities, I would like to go on swimming. I am not a good swimmer yet but soon I will be. I have been learning swimming for the last eight months and I really enjoyed it. Another sport I experience is Basketball which I used to play for a school's team when I studied at secondary school. I have not been practising it at all recently but only wish I had. This trip will certainly be a good opportunity for me to start playing it again. I wonder if you could answer me some questions? Have you had any recommendations  what type of cloths should I take with me? Do you suggest me to take cash or can I used my credit card? Will there be any tour-guide during the trip? I thank you again for your assistance and am looking forwards to hearing from you soon. yours sincerely, Prasert Charoenkul  [SEP]  Dear Kim, It has been quite a long time since I last written to you. I hope you are well. I have something really exciting to share with you. There was a concert of Michael Jackson in my city last month. It was a charity concert which was organised by a university  I am studying. My classmates and I, we were asked to do decorating the stage,  cleaning the concert's area. But guess Kim, what was the most exciting  for us was, we were asked to be the singer's interviewer. It wasn't a spokeperson Kim but just asked him a couple of questions behind the stage. I was so nervous that I couldn't remember what to say. If you imagined yourself talking to the most famous pop singer such as him how would you feel? But what I really enjoyed on that evening was when we took a photographs with him after his concert and he signed it for us on the back side of each picture. We had a wonderful evening. His concert was absolutely brilliant. Everyone was screaming, shouting and dancing while he was singing. I wish you were here with us. Are there anything wondering happen over there? Please write  me when you have time. I am looking forwards to hearing from you. Love, Prasert Charoenkul ",31.0
82," Dear Mrs Clark, I am writing with reference to the international arts festival that you organise every year. I would like to express my opinion about it and give you some suggestions that may prove to be useful. First of all, from my point of view the festival itself is a wonderful idea. That also refers to the weekend ticket you offer; in addition to being rather cheap, it allowed me to see so many interesting events in such a short time. On the other hand, I would like to notice that the festival would be able to appeal to more people if a few improvements were made. Firstly, you had said in your advertisement that artists from around the world would perform. Actually, they came from only six countries. What is more, some concert halls were too small. As a result, it was impossible for al the audience to fit in there. Finally, I suggest you should think about giving the audience the opportunity to see more plays and films. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Kathy, I'm really happy to hear from you again. I'm sorry for not writing earlier. Unfortunately, I'm quite busy so don't worry if I happen to delay  answer to some of your letters. In your last letter you wondered what the rules of behaviour at school and at home are like in my country, so I'm going to give you some information. In Poland rules that refer to the ways of being dressed at school aren't very strict; we don't wear any uniforms, but our clothes have to be clean and nice to look at. We can neither eat nor drink during the lessons. We are supposed not to be late for the lessons and, of course, students mustn't smoke at school. At home young people should help their parents do some houseworks. Generally, we are supposed to treat our parents (as well as the teachers at school) with respect and not to argue with our brothers and sisters. What I'd like to change at school is that the breaks are too short! Give my regards to your family, ",35.00
640," Dear Mrs. Ryan, I am writing this letter, concerning the information you have asked me to give you. First of all, I would like to thank you, for giving me the chance to visit Camp California. As far as I am concerned, my exams at school will have finished up to the middle of June. To be honest, I would like to spend some days with my family, before I go to California. Therefore, it would be better to go there in July. July should be the hotest month! The best season for holidays. About the accomodation, I would be pleased to stay in a tent, because this reminds me  the holidays with my family. According on the table with the activities, I will choose singing and swimming because I am a very good swimmer and  very fanatic singer from  very young . I joined my choir, when I was eight years old and I have sung solo in two concerts. I would be grateful  to tell me how much money I will need with me. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I am really impressed from your interest about my experience from the concert. I thought that you didn't like pop music and things have to deal with that. Anyway, I've enjoyed it very much! It was the best experience I've ever had in my whole life. I was trying to be with the singers all the time. It was fantastic. I wanted to touch them, as the only way to convince myself that I was with them. I didn't really have to do anything special. I should just take care of them, serving some drinks and food during the rehearshals. That's the advantage of being a volunteer. You get good experiences which you'll never forget! You have to try  once in your life and if you don't like , don't do it again. Regards, ",28.0
1234," Dear Mrs Smith, I am writting to answer your letter where you asked for information about the conferents and other points in relation with . The hotel where your group has been booked is the Palace Hotel. It is a very nice hotel in the centre of the city, and that is very near of the college which the conference is into, five minutes walking. Going walking is quicker than waiting for a taxi or a bus. When you arrive to the Colleges there will be people indicating the way to the conference room. At the end of the conference we are doing a party with some cold good and some drinks. There will be music as well for dancing. The director of the College has suggested to wear smart clothes for that occasion and I give you the same advice. About the afternoon before  leaving I have some suggestions. In the area of the Hotel there are two interesting places to visit. One is the Picasso museum and the other is an important Gallery where you can enjoy seeing differents kinds of paintings. I hope my information can help you and it has been useful for you. I am looking forwards to see you at the Conference. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  There is an invention that I think that has been very important: the computer. The computer is very useful and It has affect our own lifes, in differents meanings. The computer has done easy a lot of works. For works that you needed, for example three hours you can do them in ten minutes; the same! But computers don't have affected only  in a good way because thank you to computers the number the places of work  for the persons is minor. But, definetely they has been a very important invention. The last relationed with computers is  internet. By  internet you can comunicate with people of differents places of the world at the same moment. And you can take lots of informations about a lot of things. Every thing that you need you can find it in  internet. Nowadays computer are very developmented and it is increasing.

786," Dear Ms Ryan, I am writing to you in reply of our letter, that had let me know I am the winner of the first prize of your competition. First of all, I am very happy to spent two weeks at Camp California in the USA. Yet, I could only travel  July because I am a student and so my holidays begin on July. In addition, I would rather sleep in a tent since I like being near nature and especially singing birds. Thus, I enjoy sports and I would like to practice swimming and climbing. I am not too bad at these sports. To conclude, will you kindly let my know if I need some money and what sort of clothes I should bring with me. Yours Faithfully  [SEP]  This year, our English class has decided to make a short video about daily life at our school. (It is a graduate engineer school where we are studying mecanics and energetics.) That is why we have to single out wich lessons and other activities should be filmed. On one hand, we should be interested in the lessons. At first, the research and design courses are exiting since we are studying how cars are built. Secondly, we should interview the teacher of heat transfert since his courses are rally breathtaking. That seems to be quite surprising, yet this teacher manages to convey his knowledge. On the other hand, we should be interested in the other activities such as sports wich could appeal  more students in our school. For example, our basketball team has won a local championship. To conclude, in this short video, we must show that thanks to our school we are able to make come out the best of ourselves. ",27.0
156," 17/06/00 Dear Sir, I am writing to complain about the show ""Over the Rainbow"" which I saw at your theatre two weeks ago; as a matter of fact our evening turned out to be very disappointing. First of all I was really looking forward to the performance of the leading actor Danny Brook, but sadly he wasn't there, he was filled in by a different actor, who was instead rather disappointing. Furthermore the show should have started at 19.30 but instead it began at 20:15 which was really unpleasant. At the ticket office I also asked for a discount but they told me this wasn't possible, instead your advertisement said clearly there were discounts available! At the end of the show I was so tired that I decided to eat something at your restaurant, but surprisingly it was closed due to some unreasonable technical problems! The advertisment assured us a perfect evening but it wasn't, so I would highly appreciate  if you could refund completely our tickets. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets: he always wanted to know everything about everybody and after, of course, he would give away all he knew, but one day he had some problems... His best friend Paul couldn't put up anymore with Pat always revealing his secrets, so  decided to play a trick on him. Since Paul ran a very popular hotel in London, he told Pat that on Sunday the superstar Madonna was supposed to be staying there with her new misterious lover. Paul told Pat not to tell anyone about Madonna and especially to the press. Pat obviously couldn't help being silent about this so, since he also needed some money, he decided to reveal everything to the scandalistic press, not knowing that Paul had made up all the story! On Sunday all the english press was waiting for Madonna in front of Paul's hotel and when they discovered that it was all an invention, they got so angry that they wrote on every newspaper that Pat had made up everything! Paul finally had his revenge!! ",33.0
855," Hello, I'm so glad I won this prize, but I have some questions for you, and of course, the answers you asked me . Well, at first, I would like to travel only in July, because it's my holidays here in Portugal. And if it's possible I would like to go after day 10th, because I've got some things to do. And for me, I think  tents would be better, I don't know why but, I feel more comfortable. I think it's because the last time I travelled (with my friends), we stayed at log cabins, and when I was sleeping  felt some thing moving in my skin, then I work up frightened and when I openned my eyes, I saw lots of big ants! After that day, I've never stayed at a log cabin. Yeah, I think that's why! About activities, I enjoy most painting, because I am a plastic artist since I was nine and I've won lots of prizes with my art. And the other activity is singing. Everybody says I have an excellent voice, I like to sing when I painting too, it's so relaxing. Is that enough? I would like to ask what kind of clothe I probably will use there? And how much clothe? A lot, or  few? And what about money? Will I spend much? If you could tell me about this, I'll be glad! Greatefully Teresa J. Pereira  [SEP]  Dear Tina, You won't believe what I'm going to tell you! Remember when I told you I helped someone important? Well, listen to this. I was walking down the main street looking for a gift shop. (I had to buy something for a friend, it was his birthday) when I found a beautiful store, I stopped in front of it and start looking at the window  (outside), then I thought  interesting and came in. Suddenly, I saw a man with a cap covering his face. I tried to look again to see him better, because he seemed to be very handsome. And then he said ""if you promise me you won't get out of this store shouting and screaming and telling everyone that I'm here, I take this cap off of my face"". I didn't know what to do, I was sure he was a Robber, or even a murther! Then I said ""OK, I promise!"" (frightened, of course). Carefully, he took off the cap. Tina, guess WHO was he? Ricky Martin!! Can you believe it! And there's more! He asked me if I could help at his concert here in São Rafael. Because the store manager told him that I was the best hairdresser in the city! And his hairdresser was sick, so he and his producers were looking for one. Isn't that amazing? I met all the staff, and Ricky took lots of fotographs with me and gave me an autographied Record. Tina, I'm the luckiest girl in the world, don't you think? I'll send you some photos. Love, Teresa. ",33.0
549," Dear Sir/madam, Thank you for your letter and your congratulations. I never thought that I would win the competition. It is really wonderful. I can stay at Camp California in the U.S.A. for two weeks. I am a student at Portsmouth College and the end of this term is 23 June, so I can only travel in July. I wonder if it is all right for that time. And for my accommodation. I  prefer live in a log cabin, because it is more comfortable. I  like to relax there and enjoy the atmosphere when I live in. I like to do some activities in water and my favourite activity is swimming. Before I came  England, I swam every weekend in my country even in winter, so I choose to do some swimming and sailing while I am at the camp. Actually, my mind has already gone there, I can't wait even for a minute. I want to go there now. By the way, I would like to know  the shopping especially for clothes, I want to buy some for myself. And do you think I need to exchange money before I go there? I look forward to your letter. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  To: Mr Ted From: Meng Subject: About daily life at our school Introduction This report is aim to research the students about their daily life at school and give some suggestion about it.

Latest fashion . Leisure and sports wear . Make up .

Who have never dreamed  to be a famous singer, sportman, actor or a politician? The success of these people is so big that they are known all over the World. I think that this kind of people have a poor life because they never can be quiet because all the poeple know them and want to know a lot of things about them. They have always to be careful about what they say and what they do. In my opinion I think that if famous people is always followed by journalists it is not the responsability of the media but of the huge quantity of people who are interested in famous people life. Firstly, because it is a lot of ""scandale magazine readers"". Secondly,  because they have  admiration for them and lastly because they want dreams and see what a ""star life"" look like. In conclusion I think that people who are to much interested in other people life have not an interesting life and are unhappy!  ",27.00

Firstly, I would like to travel in July because I have 2 weeks off in the beginning of the month. For the accommodation, I would prefer in  tents because I like adventure and simplicity. Concerning the available activities, firstly, I would choose climbing because I have practised it for many years. Secondely, I am interested in discovering something that I have never done, so I would like to do sailing. Finally, I was wondering if some special clothes are required and how much pocket money I need for this trip? I thank you in advanced and looking forward to your reply.

First of all, I would like to tell you that I've never had a such good time in my life! The day one consisted in surrounding the festival's place with fences. The second day objective was to install the scene, with lights, loudspeakers and all stuff. This job was quite hard, but we took enough time to be not exhausted! The last day, in fact the concert day was absolutely fantastic. The public was so excited to see the concert that we had to place some bouncer  front of the scene, to avoid the people coming on the concert floor. Finally, the concert was exactly that the people were expected. I hop that the next time you will come with me! I'm looking forward to hearing your impressions about this! See you soon. ",30.0
353," Dear Sir, Last week I had the chance to spend time in London and this is why I decided to go to the Circle Theatre to see the musical show. Firstly, I would like to tell you I had unfortunately a very bad evening. Indeed, I was very surprise to ear when I asked for a discount that it was not possible to have one. In spite of that, I finally decided to take one ticket. The other bad point was the time when the show started, it was already 20:15 when the first star entred on the scene, but your advertisement sayed 19.30! The worst was when the actors were presented to us and the starring names were completely different than I expected. Finaly, I didn't understand why you pushed people to visit your restaurant if you don't open it after the show! This is why for all of those good reasons I am asking for some money back. I am sure you will understand my request regarding my complaint, your credibility is depending of . I look forward to earing from you . Your faithfully.  [SEP]  Our century is a century of changes, of evolution. Since the end of the 40's which is the period where the technology started , nobody can say that nothing has changed. Every day, from the morning to the evening we are completely dependent of the technology. In fact our life style is based on the technology, now, if we want to stay at home without having contact with other people, we can do it, we just need a computer and a modem and that's it. If I want to discuss  with friends or order a Pizza, I can do it  easely as I want, when it want. In spite of that, I think the technology is improving my quality of life. A good example is the celular phone, I can contact my family without  problem, I can inform my company if I had an accident with my car. If I compare my life now with the life of my grand parents, I think both are comparable, I say that because without knowing  the technology, it's difficult to imagine a best life, in fact, you leave with your time. Even if the technology is important for my quality of life, I am not able to say if it will continue to be the case in 10 years. ",27.0
443," 17 June 2000. Dear Sir and Madam I am recently spending a week's holiday in London, and I have just visited your theatre to see a musical show and I would like to complain with  couple of things. First, I  like to complain about the main features which is an actor, he might have been well known in England, but on the night, he performed abysmally. Secondly a lot of people were not very impressed with the time, because all of us at least have to wait for almost an hour until the show start. Also, a lot of people were enitieising about the facilities which said to be serve in an advertisement. For example, the discount for the tickets were not available, and especially a lot of people were disappointed that they can not visit the theatre restaurant because it was closed, due to the cleaner forgotten to clean up the mess from the previous party. Lastly, I think I could not call this as my perfect evening, so I would like to ask for a refund, and I hope as a Manager of London's newest theatre, you would handle the situation favourbly. Yours faithfully. Seung Phittikhun.  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, although he's one of my best friend, but sometimes, he's a real pain in a butt. Pat and I knew each other very well, because we are neighbours, so since we've met, Pat and I always got on very well. We always go to the same school, and he's often make more friends than I do, and everytime he's always introduce them to me. Even though Pat has got a great sense of humour and wonderful personality, he'll never be able to keep any secreats for anyone, even himself. Although, we are great friends, but sometimes people can make such a stupid mistake, and so there was one time when Pat and I had a fight, it all started when once I accidently, took the wrong bag back to my house, and there was lady's knickers inside, I was so nervous and embarassing, so I tell Pat and there he goes, he tell every single students in the school that I've stolen  girl knickers, and everyone started to call me a pervert. So that's when we had a fight. Anyway Pat eventually apologized to me and we still being best mates as ever. ",30.0
266," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to complain about some problems I had when I went to the Circle Theatre two weeks ago. Firstly, Danny Brook and Tina Truelove were supposed to perform in the show but instead of them different actors performed badly. Secondly, the show should have had started at 19:30 but it started later, at 20:15. The Theatre also promised discounts, which were not available, so I had to pay the full amount. I also wanted to visit the Theatre Restaurant after the show, but it was impossible because it closed at 20:30 and the show finished at 21:00 Finaly, I would like to ask you  £20 back as I was not satisfied with your services. I hope you pay attention to my complains. I would not like to take legal action, as it would not be convenient for both of us, but I will if I consider it necessary. I will be looking forward to hearing from you. Yours Faithfully  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets but she was my best friend and I had to tell someone what had happened to me. So I phoned her and told her the whole story. Last weekend in the Local Festival, that is held every year in our Town, I was walking with my little sister, who is three years old. She started running and got lost. So while I was looking for her I saw the Director of my school, Mr Smythe, stealing money from a small shop. I could not believe my eyes! When Mr Smythe saw me there, he told me: ""If you say a word you're going to be in serious trouble."" But Pat could not resist the temptention of calling the police. We were at school when she told me this and Mr Smythe went to our class and said to me ""May I talk to you?"". In that moment I felt so nervous and terrified that I faint. When I came around Mr Smythe was under arrest and fortunately,  thing finished well for me. ",34.0
790," Dear Mrs. Ryan: I am writing because I received your letter saying that I won first prize, a two week holiday at Camp California in  U.S.A, and that you need further information from me. Firstly, I would like to travel on July, because  is the only month I have holidays in. Secondly, I would like to stay in a log cabin because I think they're more comfortable than the tents, also because I don't like to sleep in tents very much, I think they're very cold during the night About the activities, I have chosen basketball because I enjoy playing it, and also because I know very well how to play. I used to be the captain of the selection of bascketball in my school, because I was the best to play, and I think I can still remember how to play. The second activity I chose was tennis, I am not so good, but I know how to play, I have played several times with my friends. To finish I would like to ask you for toiletries like for example shampoo, soap, etc. so that I don't have to carry them in my luggage, I think they would just occupy extra space. Another thing I would like to ask you for, is money. I think it will be an expensive trip and I don't have enough money to pay for it. Nevertheless I need money for restaurants and souvenirs that I can buy in the Camp. I think that's all, and I look foreword to hearing from you soon. Yours Sincerely, Santiago Rico S  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjouable because of several factorors. One could be when you go into a shop and you can find something that you like, and you decide to buy it, but when you see the price, you find out that it's too expencive, and you cannot afford to buy it. The only thing you mostly say is, ""If I had more money, I would buy it"", or ""I wish I had more money."" Another factor could be when you are in a shop and you are not well attended , the people that work in the shop are doing other things, and cannot help you, so you have to look for the things you want to buy by your own. I think this is a common problem in shops, and that's why sometimes people leave the shop without buying anything, and I thing the solution would be to hire more workers. The third and last factor would be when you like a certain type of clothes, and you don't find any of that kind. You just find the type of clothes you would never wear. This cituation is very annoying for most of the people, and that's what makes shopping unejoyable. ",29.0
184," Dear Sir, The reason for which I decided to write you a letter, will, I guess, surprise you. I hope you will not feel offensed, but I really needed to contest about your theater. I was present at your musical show: ""Over the rainbow"". It was very excited thinking about being at the theatre, and I though with certainty I was going to enjoy my evening. Plus, I felt very pleased when I heard that Danny Brook was part of the play: he used to be an old friend of mine in Highschool and perchance I have found him back here! You can believe I was very disappointed when I saw that he actually was not playing and I was more bewildered that noone made an apologie for it! How rude! Moreover; it was written that the show was supposed to start at 19.30; it actually started at exactly 20.15! 45 minutes latter: where we had nothing to do, but waiting. We couldn't even have a drink, because, obviously, the restaurant you talked about was closed! Really, what a mess in the administration. Although, I would have felt better if I had had a discount on my ticket, as you mentionned in the advertisement, but unfortunately, these couldn't possibly be reached either! I am sure you are smart enough to think of paying me back, so you do not lose a faithful client. Sincerely yours,  [SEP]  If more and more ingenors work on science and technology, it must be that it is really usefull: but in what particular way? For my part, I know it would be such a pain in my neck. The more I think of it, the more I realise I use modern technology a lot. I guess I could not live without many instruments. The first  I think of is  internet. What a great invention! It allows me to learn anything without having to travel through many libraries as I used to do. It also makes me write to my friends by e-mail. I did not to write at all to people until I have got   internet. By this procedure, you only type and send, no need to going to the post-office! Of course this is just because I am lazy, I actually could force me a little, and then go to the library and to the post-office, but  internet just makes it easier! I am also very fond of cell-phones. These are also such a relief. I can go anywhere without being nervous about the fact, that maybe someone is trying to reach me! Modern technology changed my daily life by making it easier and by turning me into a lazy woman. Nevertheless, this easy life has then offered me  to be more peaceful and I think it is essential. Although I am thankful to modern technology! ",35.0
119," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to complain about the musical show ""Over the Rainbow"", that I went to see on the 16th of June. Firstly, the actor suppossed to be Danny Brook, but he was not, it was another actor, who I have never seen before, so, as you can imagen, I was very disappointed. Another complain is about the time that the musical show started, the advertisement said it started at 19:30, but it did not, we had to wait 45 minutes. It was terrible. Now, about the tickets, the were different prices but there were not discounts, and because of this, many people could not see the show, especially students. Finally, when the musical show finished, and I have to say, a bit late, I went to the theatre's restaurant to eat something but this place was closed because the chef had already gone. At  is explain it was not the perfect evening that I expected to have and I would like to have my money back because of the reasons that I mentioned before. Looking forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Pat, Maria's best friend Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, so Maria was very disappointed when she realised that Manuel knew the truth about the feelings that Maria had for him, in fact, she was so angry she  almost kill but, she couldn't because Pat was her best friend. Maria talked to Pat about the stupid thing that she did, but Pat refused to apologaising to her, because she felt it wasn't a mistake and she did it for only one reason: help Maria to get the man that she loved. Maria was speechless, it was the first time that she didn't know what to do, so she decided to stop talking to Pat. After 3 weeks, Maria got ill so she was not available to go to school. Some  friends phoned her everyday, except Pat, the only friend that Maria really loved, despite that, she was not sad. One day, when Maria was seating in her bedroom, someone knock  the door, it was Manuel, he was worried for her. Maria was nervous, but for the first time, she could talk to him as she never did before, and at the end of the day, she was the happiest person of the world, she gave her first kiss and she had Pat's friendship back, after all, everything happened because of her.

1008," Dear Pete, Many thanks for your letter which arrived must when I was thinking of you. I hope you and your family are feeling well. I remember that I agreed to look after your flat while you are in New York on holiday. The only problem is that on 4th April I have my graduation. As you know I'm in Ferndown now spending  last minutes studying for exams. I would like to ask you if my arrival at 4 o'clock on the 5th April is suitable for you. If not, pleas let me know. I'm sure we will find another solution. It's very kind of you to let me use things in your flat. I'm over the moon! Can I also ""take care"" of your computer and CD player and bicycle? Can you also let me know when you are going to come back on the 20th. Will it be or dinner time maybe? If yes, great! I will be able to see you. You know that helping you it's a real pleasure for me, you really don't have to become flat broke because of buying things for me but I am interested in American culture. So  tiny ""Statue of Liberty"" will be nice. I will finish now as I have  mountain of work to do. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Take Care Yours,  [SEP]  ""junk food instead of a carrot"" Young man, are you aware of what you eat and drink? Are you sure that your diet is healthy enough to help you grow up? In today's fast moving world young people spend less and less time cooking or eating healthy food. When they are at home, especially children, parents take care of them and always prepare some good dinner with meat or a fresh salad for supper. However, students who never have time for  healthy diet full of minerals, vitamins or fibre usually finish on ""McDonalds"", hamburgers or Bic Macs. Moreover, very often  school canteen doesn't offer diversified  food like different kinds of bread or salads. Usually we don't eat regularly and in good proportions. Our grandparents always remembered the value and quality of food. They found time to eat something hot for dinner - the main meal  and even if the times were worse, people were more sensible. In my opinion people, especially the young, should become more aware of what and when they eat as well as they should work on their lifestyles and keep their head. ",34.00
202," Dear Mr. Smith, During my last holiday in London, I was visiting your theatre in order to see ""Over the rainbow"". You wrote some things in your advertisement and I was disappointed that  wasn't true. First you have written that the starring were Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, but the real actors were different. It was a disappointing for me, because this actors were recommended by my friend, because he knows Danny and Tina. You have also written in your advertisement that it would started at half past seven but it started at 20:15! So we had to wait more than a half hour. It wouldn't be mind if the restaurant had pressed in order to eat or drink something, but it was closed, and it hadn't also opened after the show, because the waitress had to clean up the theatre room. Over these the tickets were not discount available as you have written  in your advertisement. So it wasn't a perfect evening for me and I think about it, if I can have my money back. If it's possible, please write back. Sencerely ...  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets and so his hole schoole knew from Sara's experience. Sara was a very good puple. She didn't learn a lot but she knew all  important things. She was a very nice person and she helped always if somebody need her help. One day she had to make the shopping for her mother. She had to buy a lottery-ticket and other things for her. After she had done this she went home, but she didn't buy the ticket because she thought there aren't no change  to win. She spent this  only for a magazin. After she came home her mother was sitting in front of the TV and looked after the lottery-numbers. Suddenly she jumped out of her armchair and shouted: ""I have won the jack-pot"". Sara was out of breath and after  she had told her mother, she hadn't bought the ticket. Her mother get angry but some hours later she was friendly again. Sara couldn't understand the fact, that she didn't do the right thing. She had earn a lot of money, so she would be more careful with doing things . ",26.0
173," Dear Sir, I am writing to complain about a number of points. I went to London on holiday and to The Circle Theatre to see Over The Rainbow. Although, this musical show was not as good as I expected. First of all, was the show suppossed to start at 19.30, but it started first at 20.15. To make matters worse, instead of Danny Brook performing you had another actor, which was very disappointing. Secondly, it says in your advertisement that discounts would be available, despite the fact they were not. On top of everything, you recommended to visit the theatre restaurant after the show. however this was closed due to lack of personall. According to your brochure it says this would be the perfect evening out. According to my experience it was not. I am expecting a full refund and compensation for the discomfort I have suffered. I am looking foward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully Carley Agda Nilsen  [SEP]  Fashion of the future. Designers are improving their skills all the time. Nowadays, there are more and more people who wants to become designers and the competion is increasing. Everybody wants to be the best. Due to this the quality of clothes is getting better and in 100 years we will be asking for a bigger variety of clothes. Although, the price of clothes is increasing, people still buy them. We give other things priority so we are able to afford our clothes. On the whole, people nowadays, do care more about their appearance and will be continuing to do . It appears that people are more aware about clothes and also work. I think people in the future will begin to only wear fashionable clothes. If you feel nice, in an outfit your confident will be likely to increase and this might also help you to get a better career in your work, something which is very important today. ",37.0
271," Mr John Smythe, I'm writing to tell you about the horrible evening I had on Friday. I was very excited with the idea of going to the theatre, but it didn't work out as I thought it will. First of all the starring actors were supposed to be Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, Tina did act, but Danny Brook was replaced by an awful actor whose name I don't recall. Second of all, the play was suposed to start at 19:30, but it started at 20:15. I'm not used to waste my time sitting on a chair waiting, I do have better things to do with it. Another thing I want to complain about, is that your advertised that discounts were available, but there wasn't any discount at all. To finish my ""marvelous"" evening, I wanted to eat at your restaurant, but it was closed and no reason was given. As I didn't have a ""perfect evening out"", I think I have the right to ask for my money back. I hope you understand. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Pat's story Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Now you've probably asking yourself what does it mean, well, now I'm going to explain it to you. Two years ago in this school, Pat and I used to be best friends. We used to tell everything to each other. I was having some family problems, so my marks were getting down and down. Pat was worried, she didn't know what to do. One day she looked me in the eyes with a sharp deep look, Never have I seen such a deep look: and asked me what was happening and I told her as I always used to. That afternoon she visited me and told me a plan she had designed to make my marks rise. It consisted in stealing the school list from the computer, in other words, hack  the school software. I thought it was a great idea, so I stole about ten tests we were planned to do. Pat couldn't stand the pressure of the ""crime"" so she told the school directors that I stole the tests. I was punished, nearly expelt, but Pat didn't receive any punishment. I never accused her of lying, and I you ask me why, I really don't know. ",34.0
677," Dear, Helen Ryan Thank you very much for the prize at camp California in America. For the time that I would like to travel  must be on July only. This is because my A-levels exams is coming up so I really need times to revise, and July is the only month and time that I am free. An accommodation, I  prefer to stay in a tent. This is because it is my first time to see an outside world by myself so I need to gather up new experiences. I have never ever stayed in a tent before but some of the people I know said that it is fun and much more exiting. As I am a person who is love and doing activities, so I would like to choose to do sailing and photography. Once I used to take a photography course at my school and my teacher taught me well about taking photo. Also I tried how to sail before, but I am not perfectly good at it, but I  love to sail more. Finally, I would like to ask about what kind of clothes do I need to bring? and the money, do I need much of them? Please, give me a suggestion about these . Your faithfully  [SEP]  Dear, Kim How are you? I have written to you to tell you about the greatest experience that I ever have. Last week I offered myself to help the others at the concert and it was amazing. I couldn't believed how close I was to the band. There were so many youngsters at the concert, but because I was the youngest in a helping team so I guess that I was the luckiest at that moment. A concert did very well and I enjoyed it so much. Later on the band took a break for ten or fifteen minutes, so I served them with glasses of fizzy drink and chocolate bars, biscuits and sandwiches. You will not believe how close I was to the singers. After a break, the bank have to carried on  the concert for another one hour and a half. People at the backstage including me were helping to clean up all the stuff and  ready for the end of the concert. The time has come, when the band finished the concert, we have to served them drinks again and helped to clear up the stage. Afterwards, I have a chance to took photos with them and have their autographs etc. It was the enjoyable time in my life and  wished that you were there with me. From this letter, I am sure that you should be able to share this experience with me. Lots of Love ",32.0
784," Dear Ms. Ryan I recived your letter recently, and I am really happy learning that I won the first prize. So, I am writing to you to answer your questions. First of all, I have to tell you that my only chance is go there in July, it does not matter the dates, but it is important for me to be back before the 1st of August, because that day I will start a summer job. About he acommodation during those two weeks, I would rather staying in a log cabin, as it is really difficult for me to be in a little and close room. Your next question is about the activities that I could do at the camp, after browse through the list, I would like to take part in climbing and photography activities, as these are my favourite hobbies. I had a induction climbing course two years ago, and I still going to climbing regulary, I can do a V+ level climb. On the other hand I had a photography course five years ago, and I took part in several competitions. Finally, could you tell me how far is the nearest town or village? Can we get there by public transport? Looking forward for your answer. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Shopping, what an exciting thing! Going out to spend a day shopping is something very popular, the shopping centers are always busy,  people going up and down carrying bags and looking at window shops,  seems everbody is happy. Really? Sometimes things can be wrong and the situations changes and becomes a nightmare. Firstly  is the parking problem, if you go to shopping late at weekends for instance, it's really difficult to find a place to park your car, and when you get the place,  pay for it! Then the search for a nice cloth starts, and when eventually you get it, it isn't your size, but also the colour that you like is not available. Finally you've found out something really wonderful, time to pay! With the hurries you've forgotten to bring any cash, but you can use the plastic money, the shop assistant pass the credit card through the machine, after  few seconds  again, and  another time more, suddenly his face changes and  says you that the card is fault! No choice, you have to leave your nice clothes and go away feeling bad and sad. To sum up, shopping is not always enjoyable, but don't worry, the shooping center  still there waiting for you! ",33.0
779," Dear Mrs Ryan, I am writing to enquire about the competition that I won and give some details to you about myself and my interests. In the first place, I prefer to travel on July because my school will not be closed before this date. Secondly, a tent holiday is always attracted me so I would like to stay in a tent rather than in a log cabin. In my spare time, I enjoy playing basketball with my friends and I also like swimming. When I was in primary school, I was one of the members in  swimming-school team. I am not really good at basketball but I think it is a good fun. Because of these reasons, I choose basketball and swimming from the list which  were given. I would like to know what types of clothes I need and beside this, how much money I need during my vacation. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,   [SEP]  Dear Kim, It's ages since I've heard from you. I hope you and your family are well. Last month, I had a great time at the concert of ""Dragon"" which is the most popular hard-rock group all over the world. They had a concert in my hometown that's why the organizators were looking for young people who can speak English. I applied and They took me on. I took part in the security department. The staff in that departnent are really friendly and helpful and they are also huge like giants. Basicly, I helped them connecting with the local police and getting some electronical equipments that they needed. They treated me as if I was the private secretary of the department, because of this sometimes I felt that the power was in my hands. By the way, I have already been invited  their next concernt.

309," Dear Manager: I reciently was in London,  in my sister's home, and I went to se ""Over the Rainbow"". I had a lots of problems and I would like to tell you about them. Early that day I went to buy the tickets and I decided to buy the expensive ones, like the promotion paper said they made discounts to people that worked at the British Institute. I mentioned it, but they told me that  promotion had ended a long time ago. Why do you put  on the paper then? In the evening I got a flat tire, and because of this I got late to the show, when I got to my place, it was used (it cost a lot) and they took me to the cheapest seats, where I couldn't see a thing. After waiting a while in this uncomfortable place the show started, I waited 45 minutes and then the actors appeared, but I find myself that the main one wasn't Danny Brook, it was an impostor. And finally when the show ended I decided to go  eat something, but the restaurant was closed because the chef was sick. Sorry, but all these stuff are not proffesional, and I am going to make a demand exactly because you don't have that, if you don't give me my money back. I hope you understand me  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Yesterday I decided to go to the ""blue disco"" because the guy I liked was going to be there. But there was a little problem and it was that my parent's didn't let me go alone to disco's, so I had to go illegaly, and I decided I would do it. That night I waited until my parents were asleep and I went out  my window. I had told Pat to pick me up, she was the only one that new my plan. I made her promise she wouldn't tell anyone my secret. So when we arrived to the disco there was my guy waiting for me. To sumarize the night I am going steady with him, and he took me home. The next morning Pat came to my house, I was sleeping so she talked to my mom and she suddenly asked her: At what time did Catana arrive  last night?... All the truth was then told, and now I am grownded for life. She defintevely doesn't know how to keep secrets. ",30.0
772," 13 June, 2000 Dear Helen. I've been thrilled eversince I received your letter indicating my luck of having won the first prize in the competition that you organized recently. In response to the letter, I am sending mine to state the options and choice that I have made concerning the date of the trip, the place where I will be staying and the two activities that I have chosen along with some questions. Firstly, I wish to travel on July as I already have plans for June which is to visit France for 3 weeks as soon as my summer vacations commences. Secondly, to the question of lodging, I have chosen tents since I enjoy camping in them very much. Among the numerous choices of activities, I am considering taking those of golf and surfing. I have been playing golf since the age of 8, therefore I am certain that I will not require help of any sort. However, as this will be my first time to go surfing, I am willing to take classes for beginners. Lastly, I've been struggling with the question of money and clothing and would lie to be informed about the climate there so that I will be able to pack the clothes that I need and I would be thankful if you would consider sending me an estimation of  amount of money I will have spend in the camp. I am looking forward in being received in camp California. Thank you in advance. Yours sincerely, Regina Kong   [SEP]  13 June, 2000 Dear Kim, Hi Kim. How are you? I am fine and so is my family. I was glad to receive your letter from you and after having heard that you are interested in helping pop singers have a concert, I started writing as soon as I could. I thin it's a wonderful idea and my advice is to take it if you have an offer! I had so much fun helping my friends' band having their concert. At first, they asked me to decorate the stage since I like drawing, but as I wanted to get more involved, they said that I could also help them set up the lights, the microphones and the instruments. I have to admit that it wasn't always easy, but my effort was worth every penny. The concert was a hit and the stage looked fabulous! The audience seemed pretty impressed as well. I thought it was a great opportunity to see how things turn out so well when you put everybody's different talents together. I'm not sure of what part you're interested in, but I think drawing the background for the stage was the best, and I suggest that you try doing it too. If you have any questions, please write to me. I wish you the best of luck and hope you have fun helping the singers as much as I did Lots and lots of kisses, Regina ",37.0
521," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to complain about your music show entitled ""Over the Rainbow"" Which I saw during my holiday in London. Firstly, I expected to see the play by Danny Brook who is my favourite actor. However, without any announcement, a different actor was playing his role. Secondly, according to the advertisement, the show would have started at 19:30, but it started at 20:15. Moreover, the theatre restaurant was closed because of the equipment mentenance. You should have let us know such information in advance. Finally, although I heard the student discount ticket was available, the ticket salesman said I should have bought it at least one day before the show. I was not satisfied with your show at all. Therefore, I think you should pay some money back for me. Please let me know how you think of my complain and request as soon as possible. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Thank you for modern technology. I think modern technology has changed my daily life, especially in communication with my best friend who is studying in Britain. We had seen each other once a week before she left Japan for Britain. I used to think I would miss her. But now I can communicate with her every day by e-mail. Furthermore, we can talk on the phone. I feel no distance as if I was speaking with a friend in Japan. Without a computer and a telephone, I couldn't contact her easily and I may lose touch with her. in addittion, I could go tot Britain to see her by plane. Before the plane was invested, I suppose it might take several months to visit Britain by ship. In present, it takes just 12 hours by plane. Thanks to such modern technology, I can improve the relationship with my friend, even if she is living  away from me. ",27.0
1199," Dear Mrs Maria Smith, I am writing to give you some information  asked  in your letter, which I received this morning. Your group has been booked in  Palace Hotel which is one of the most comfortable hotels in London. Personally, I am glad that you will have this opportunity to use its various facilities. It is based in the city centre and is about half an hour by underground from the conference. In my oppinion the easiest way to get there from the conference would be by taking the Picadelly line. However you would take bus number 150, if you would like to have a look at the city centre and you have some free time also. Regarding to the end-of-conference party, I would suggest to wear some dress for a woman and an elegant suit for a man, though, it is no  formal do. The party will finish quite late so we've decided to provide a bus which would take you to the hotel safely. Basicaly, during three hour time in the afternoon nobody is able to visit all of  interesting places of London. However you would have a long walk along the river to take some essential photos. I look forward to welcoming you. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Are you always happy when your telephon ring? As far as I am concerned the telephone was invented in  19th century. It has been affecting our lifes very quickly, although there were some different ways of communication as TV, for instance. Since the internet was introduced, many of us wouldn't have imagined the lifes without this. We were able even to have our own telephone kept in our pocket for a some time. However, are you always happy when your personal phone rings. On the other hand I wonder whether you have experienced some situations when you wouldn't have your mobile switched on. This invention has affected my life completely. Since I have been traveling around the world I would have imagined beeing in tough with my family or friends without  internet or my mobile phone. In spite of having the opportunity of keeping  contact with friends at the time  we are far away from home, we should have been knowledge how to use it without interrupting others. ",29.00
230," Dear the manager My name is Sally Smith. I went to see a musical show last Wednesday. I had a very disappointing evening. In the advertisement you said ""Danny Brook"" is the actor but it wasn't . It was somebody else. I went to see the show because I like Danny Brook. The person that played instead of Denny was not very good. The show supposted to start at 19.30 pm but it started at 20.15 pm. It was very late. We had to wait nearly an hour. Staff did not tell us why it started late. When I bought tickets, they did not discount at all. I asked them about discounts because I saw  in the advertisement. They ignored me. We bought tickets without  discount. I don't know that they   discount for somebody else or not. After the show we went to the theatre restaurant but it  closed. It closed at 11 pm. It was not our fault that we went in after 11 pm. The show finished late. The restaurant should  open until the show finish. It was not a perfect evening at all. Could I please have my money back? It was £60 for  tickets. I was very disappointed about this. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours sinecerely Sally. Smith.  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.

He wanted Pat to keep it between them but Pat did not keep his promise. She told us about it. When Tim found out that we knew his problem and  tried to help him. He was very angry with Pat. He wasn't talk to Pat at all. Basically, Tim did not know that Pat was not very good at keeping secrets. She did not know when she can speak or not speak. We  so worry about her in the future.

239," Dear Sir, I am writing to you to complain about the show which I saw last Friday at your theatre. The show was called 'Over the rainbow' I was not pleased with the way that  was set out. First of all, when I went and bought my ticket, there was no discount but in your advertisement it said clearly that discounts are available and as a result my ticket  was bought  more expensive. Secondly, the show I went  was the evening one, which was supposed to start at 7:30 p.m. but it had a 41 minutes delay and  ended up starting at 8.15 p.m. Furthermore, the original actor was Danny Brook but it changed to a different actor which acted terribly and was very disappointing. Last of all, it said in your advertisement that there is a theatre restaurant  after the show but it turned out to be closed because it was redecorating and no annocement was made. I didn't have a perfect evening out and instead I had a awful evening out. Therefore I would like are refund of my ticket and I would like a apolygists. Thank you from you Your Sincelery,   [SEP]  What will clothes be like 100 years from now? What do you think modles will wear in  cat walks? Will they wear anything? Who know? Nowaday, people look at fashion-magesins or get opinions from their friends  to decide what to wear in different occasions Will they still do the same 100 years later? In my opinion, I think clothes will be a lot differente  100 years later compare to now. As new materials are made and new styles are created either by designers or people themselves which leads to changes in fashion but on the other hand come materials will probably still be used such as jeans, which was invented ages ago in America. and people nowadays still use jeans as a common material. If you walk out  to the street now, you will probably see more than half the people wearing clothes that are made with jeans which is incredibly surprising! From my point of view, I think people will wear more clothes that are see-through in particular. As people are wearing thinner and thinner clothings to show off their figure They might as well just wear clothes that are see through to give it a better effect! so if you want to know what clothes will be like 100 year later, the only thing you can do is to WAIT!

Moreover, a variety of micro computers are now everywhere such as in your car, on your radio and so on. Have a good feeling with it!: On one side, the modern technology is extremely important, on the other hand you shouldn't abuse of it. Conclusion: I do think, however, the modern technology is essential for human being nowadays. Although the world of computers will develop day by day, I lively hope we (human being) could mantain our personality of seeing things. ",22.0
210," 17-6-00 Dear Sir/Madam: I am writing to complain about the musical show: Over the Rainbow, presented in your theatre on 15th of June. I went to the theatre to buy the ticket and expected to have a discount as I was a student. However, the salesman in the box office told me the discount tickets had been sold out. I could not understand why but  still bought the ticket because I was crazy about Danny Brook. Then, I went into the theatre on time but became a little bit angry for waiting until 20:15, forty-five minutes after the expected starting time. Furthermore, I was so disappointed to find out that Danny Brook was not on the stage and the leading actor sang so bad that I left the theatre before it finished. At last, I went to the theatre restaurant but it was closed because it needed cleaning. I think it was definitely not a perfect evening as garenteed in your advertisement. I look forward to having a full refund in the very near future as I did not enjoy it at all. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Now everybody in the class knew my mum was a cleaner and teased me for having such kind of mum. I was so sad about it and did not forgive Pat even though she apologise for thousands of times. A week later, when I was still in a bad mood, my form teacher, Mrs Brown, talked about jobs in our English lesson. She told us there were numerous types of job in the world. Some offered a high salary while some did . However, they are equal important for our society. 'Who wants to be a doctor?' She asked. Many students raised their hands. 'Who wants to be a lawyer?' Again, many students put up their hand. But when she asked who wanted to be a cleaner, nobody raised his hand and I felt so shameful that I lowered my head. 'Cleaner is a very good job.' Mrs Brown said with a loud voice. 'If there were no cleaner, who would clean the school for us, who would keep the environment nice and tidy.' Suddenly, all the classmates applauded and smiled to me with respect. The teacher also grinned and I was so impressed and repeated the words in my heart: 'All the jobs have the same importance.'

437," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to share with you some feelings I have after watching a musical show, which was played at The Circle Theatre last week. Unfortunalety my feelings are rather bad. I had a week's holiday in London last week, when I saw your advertisement concerning  'Over the Rainbow' musical show. The advertisement looked pretty interesting and I dicided to go to the theatre to watch this musical show. Especialy due to the fact that I wanted to see Danny Brook - my favourite actor. I was really disappointed when I saw a different actor. The 'theatre' even did not appologize for this range. To make things worse the show started 45 minutes later than it should have been ( started at 20:15 instead of 19:30). Despite I am a student and the advertisement said that discounts were available, I was refused to buy a half-a-price ticket, and the explaination 'why' wasn't sufficiant. I tried to relax after the show, so I made my way to the theatre restaurant, which according to the advertisement ought to be open at that time. Unfortunately it was not, which made me even angier. There was no information  why it was closed and if it would be open at all. The advertisement say 'your perfect evening out', however it was the worst evening I have had in London. I would like you give me my money back. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. I told her about my plans on Monday, however on Friday almost half of my class knew what's going on. I was the only boy in my class who didn't have a driving licence. I wanted to tell them about this after I would pass the exam. Saturday morning I went to the driving center for my first lesson. I had never driven a car before. I hope that nobody would watching me. Unfortunately Pat was there and half of my class. I felt terrible. The instractur opened the car  and asked me to sit on the drivers sit. It was the worst time I ever had. At the beginning I couldn't start the engine. Then I drove very slowly very ofen crossing the white line on the road. I looked at the mirror and I saw how my friends were lauthing. It made my crazy. I started doing stupid things: turn right instead of left and so on. Next day, I decided that I don't want to go to school any more. I was afraid that everybody would comment  my first lesson. I wish I hadn't told Pat about my plans. Eventually the things weren't so bad. I went to school and everyone was very friendly. Pat appologized  me for not keeping the secrets. At the begining I was very angry but in the end I said that everything is O.K. We are good friends nowadays, however I will never tell her my secrets. ",25.0
1009," Dear Pete, I hope you have a fantastic time in New York and please don't worry about your flat. Everything is going to be under control! But I want to make some points clear before you leave London. First of all, I think I'm going to be busy on the 4th of April. Can we change the date into the 5th of April, at 4 o'clock? Thanks very much for letting me use your things during the stay. I may need to use particularly the computer and the CD player. Is that OK for you? By the way, if you tell me around what time you will be back on the 20th, maybe I can prepare something for dinner. I know you're going to be too tired to cook after 11 hours of flight. Last of all, thanks for your consideration about bringing me a present. Anything as a souveniere would be quite enough for me. I'll leave it to you. I know you have a good taste in presents!! Have a great time in the States. Love,  [SEP]  To whom it may concern, With regards to your advertisement in ""The Traveller"" magazine, I would be pleased to tell you why I want to apply for this trip. The first thing that caught my attention in the advert was ""... eight people from different countries... "". I am very interested in meeting and spending time with people from other cultures. I am generally known as an easy-going person and I can remain calm in the emergency situations and I am quite reliable too. Obviously a sailing trip has not got the most comfortable conditions but I think this makes the idea more exciting. I believe that facing difficulties will make me more mature in the real life and having friends from all over the world will help me to think ""worldwide"". I hope this letter will be enough to explain why I want to do this trip. Yours sincerely ",34.00
603," Thank you for the letter you have sent recently. It was a surprise to know that I won the first prize. The reasons I am really writing, However, is to give you some details of my trip to California. I'll be taking an English Examination at the end of June and I think it would be a good idea if I can travel in July because it's the only month I can spend abroad this year. In the letter you said that  accommodation provided can be either  tents or  log cabins. I would prefer to stay in  tents so that I will have the chance to be in contact with the nature as well as the scenery around . Another thing I would like to choose from the activity list is singing (because I take part in a chorus at school) and photography. I'm really good  taking pictures, it's a way I have to express my feelings. I wonder if you could send me more information about what kind of clothes have we bring. Do you think you could also let me know how much money we will need during our stay at the Camp. I would be grateful if you could send me a brochure and a map showing where the camp is. thanking you in anticipation. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  What a surprise it was to get  letter from you after all this time. Sorry I haven't written for so long but I was really busy trying to apply for a job. This is just to let you know with whom I worked. In order to celebrate the 125 aniversary of the city, the Coun Council organised an open air concert. It was a summer night and all the citizens, as well as tourists, had the opportunity to attend. The pop band ""Five"" arrived into town and needed people to help with not only the organisation but also   the stages and  sound. I knew some help was needed so I decided to speak to the manager. I couldn't believe  when he said: ""O.K. if you want to help, here is a list of what you can do."" My job was to leave some leaflets on shops, restaurants and  streets. Working with this band was an experience I will never forget. What I really enjoyed was been part of the staff. Although I was too nervious, I knew I could do the job well. I'd love to hear all your news, why don't you come and visit me? Perhaps I could show you the pictures I took. I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon. Love from, ",36.0
673," Dear Mrs Ryan, I am writing in reply to your letter in which you communicate  I have won first prize in your competion. I am glad. Thank you very much. Now I am answering your questions and then I would like to know  further information about travel and accomodation. I would like to travel in July because in June I am going to take some exams at University and at the moment I do not know the exact date. I can tell you I am only free in July. I would prefer an accomodation in  log cabins because I am not keen on tents and I think that a log cabin is more comfortable than a tent. As regard as the chance to do two activities while I am at the Camp I would like to practise painting and photography. I am a painter in oils from life and my subjects are landscapes, people, animals. I like also taking photographs, for example during my journeys or trips. So when I go back home I can use my best pictures to reproduce them as a painting. Would you give me some information about  clothes to wear there? I would like also to know how much money I can bring. Looking forward to hearing from you Yours sincerely, Billy Esposito  [SEP]  There is somebody who says that 'Shopping is not always enjoyable' and who is happy only when  can go shopping. In the first I do not think that shopping is enjoyable when you must do so in a hurry or for duty. If you have to run from one shop to another and always looking at the watch, doing shopping is a terrible activity. On the other hand if you can walk  without anytime problem with a good friend I think that shopping is very enjoyable. For istance, it is funny enter a clothes shop and try on a skirt or a t-shirt although you do not buy anything. To sum up I enjoy wasting money and buying useful things or not. I often like getting gifts for my relatives and friends. In my opinion, shopping is relaxing above all on Saturdays when you have finished a work week and you are expecting a wonderful Sunday. ",29.0
1060," Dear Mr Robertson, I am writing to confirm that we have received your programme for our class for the three days, during our stay in London, and would like to thank you. Firstly, the whole class is very pleased with the programme, especially with the visit to the National Art Gallery. As we have been told, there are a lot of interesting paintings and ancient sculptures  in which we all are keen to see it. A couple of days ago, my classmates made the suggestion, that they would also like to see the London Fashion And Leisure Show in London,  Central Exhibition Hall, which was advertised in a school magazine and there is free entry for students. The show includes the latest fashion wear, sports wear for spare time, make up and hairstyles. At the same time it would be a great opportunity for most of us because we are going to study ""Art and Design"" next year. We agreed in the class  to visit this show on Tuesday 14 March in the afternoon after lunch instead of  shopping. Do you think it is possible? We would be grateful, if you could consider our suggestion and hope to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  To be famous or not to be famous? Well, first of all, I think it's quite difficult to be a musician, film star or a politician without being followed by journalists all the time. In my opinion, most of these people are aware of the consequences  like not to have a ""private life"" anymore. As soon as they are famous, they are surrounded by their fans and reporters in every place. I can imagine, how annoying it can be sometimes. Just think that you'd like to go shopping, clubbing or to a restaurant with friends. There's really no way to be together just only with your friends or relatives without being disturbed by these paparazzis. On the one hand I can understand how important it is for the journalists to take pictures for the newspaper or magazines they work for. It is the way how they earn money, of course. But on the other hand I have to mention that they are going too far sometimes to take a picture. For example Lady Diana. Do you think she would have been still alive if she and her boyfriend hadn't been followed by these nosy paparazzis? Well, this will be an open question to anyone. ",35.00
324," Dear Manager of the theatre: I am writing a letter to complain about the musical show I saw last week when I was in London. I thought that I would have a great time there, but I was really disappointed in that evening. You said there would be stars such as Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, whose music is my favourate, but the musicians were actually some other people whose names I had never heard of. In the advertisement of the show, you said it would begin at 19.30, actually it was 45 minutes delay. The discounts of tickets that you mentioned were not exist. It could make things worse that the visit to your theatre restaurant, which had already been closed because of  lack of customers, was canceled. However, what a let down! I would be grateful if you could give  the money back. If I cannot get your satisfying reply within a month I shall go to the consumer protection organisation to sue you. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully.  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed our daily life. Our life has been influenced by modern technology. Five years ago, you could be proud of your 486 computer, which can only be put inside a museum as an antique now. Then how does it changed our daily life? I have been an enthusiast of music for a long time, I used  tape player and I felt it was excellent. Today, there are multi-choices such as  discman (CD player). MD walkman and MP3 player, which are considered to be more portable and have  better timbre. Communication has been more conventional, we can simply make a phone call,  sent e-mails or faxes instead of writing letters and waiting for a long time. Especially the improvement  of personal computer has greatly helped the spread of information by using  internet, you can book newspaper, magazines,  even go shopping online. Therefore, our life has been influenced and changed by  developing of technology. In conclusion, we should work hard to learn knowledges, making the future better and better. ",27.0
845," Dear Ms. Ryan, Thank you very much for your letter. I was really amazed to have actually won first prize after years of unsuccessfully entering competitions! In connection with the questions you asked, please find my answers as follows: - I could prefer to travel in July as this is the only time I can take my annual leave. - As far as accommodation is concerned, I would prefer the log cabin due to the fact that I am not a teenager any more and crawling in and out of a tent has become cumbersome to me. - My choice of sports are swimming and tennis. Swimming has always been my favourite sport and I can say that I have become an excellent swimmer over the years. Tennis I only started four years ago, but have found that I am quite talented at it, having won several competitions during the last two years or so. Please let me know if meals are included and if not which facilities are offered in the way of restaurants or self-catering. Looking forward to hearing from you, I remain, Yours sincerely  [SEP]  The book Cry Freedom by John Briley is certainly one which will take its place in South African history. Therefore, I think it is a time document which will remain of interest and which will be read again and again, also by non-South Africans. Generations of young South Africans black, white or brown will be reminded of one of the worst times their country went through. Steve Biko and Donald Woods will be remembered always. Steve Biko for becoming a martyr to the black freedom movement of these dark years. A peaceful man who was caught up in the wills of the apartheid regime, dying such a violent death. Donald Wood for literally jumping over his own shadow and risking his life and that of his family in the process of reporting the vile crimes of the SA. police force. In the end he had to leave the country of his birth to escape imprisonment. It is my firm believe that this book will remain a piece of literature which will not lose its actuality, in a world where people are hounded for their colour or religion. ",35.0
70," Dear Sir, First of all I would like to say that organising an International Arts Festival was a great idea. I enjoyed it and found  worthy to visit. The Annual International Arts Festival, which was held on the 21st and 22nd of November, was colourful with the stars and artist coming from around the world. Although this was true, they were from only six countries. You could have let us get used to more cultures by inviting  from some other countries too. The concert halls were not big enough to let all the guests in. So I could hardly participated in all of the concerts. The organisation was very good I found chances to see dance shows, art exhibitions and to listen to writers, but there could be more plays and films next year. It was really a reasonably-priced weekend for me, but you should also recognise new activities like competitions on singing songs,  drawing a portrate next year. Then it would be excellent. Thanks for everything. Yours Sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Ana, I have received your letter. It is nice to hear from you again. I'm in a hurry, so I will directly come to the point. Everywhere and  everytime in our lives we face with the rules. Some find them as a source of protection of their rights and others as a limitation of them. For me they are both. At schools we have certain rules like being in the class, sitting in your place before the lecture starts, bringing in your equipment with you, keeping quiet during the lessons and raising your hand when you want to talk. I think these are international rules which help things to go in order. Contrary there are other rules which annoy us like the clothing ones. You should wear the same things every time, no changes and alternations are allowed. It makes us like robots and  feel bad psychologically, because we want to be different and free in   wearing. Also the attendance rules put a strain on us. If we don't come to school for 10 days, then we can't pass the class. They don't care if we have problems, exams to study  or if we are ill. At homes we have again rules, but more flexible ones. You should be punctual when coming to  dining table, respectful, do your home works and watch TV less and not too loud. I would like to change the attendance and clothing rules in school, but I don't have the enough power. They are against democracy I think. Anyway hope to hear from you soon. With all my love, ",33.00

As  your questions, I am free to travel only on July because I will having my holiday after finished the exams. And, I have to returned to my university by August. I prefer to stay in  log cabin rather than in  tent because I am not used to with narrow space and feel more comfortable with a place like  bedroom. Furthermore, I prefer to do painting and photography as my hobbies and my fasinative in art and enjoyed to take a photograph of wildlife. Finally, please could you give me an idea what sort of clothes to bring? and how much would be  spend there. Also, please advice  for any necessary things to prepare and bring. I looking forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Kim, Sorry for I haven't written to you for such a long time, but I've got a good excute! Last month, I was partly in the concert teams. It was a big one that I never thougth and I couldn't imagine how amazing was it. I didn't know what is my responsible until they called me to  trained. What a surprised! and unbelieveable, I was responsible for looking after the pop stars. You might understand how excited I was. But, I've got though it. I have to taken care of them during a break, served a drink,  clothes,  even brought them some cigaratte and anything they wants. I think they are so hospitality and warm with people around them. You know! because of these are change all my opinions about  self-important behavior of superstar. The most appreciated was  they've given me their latate CD with  signature. Marvellous thing! and of couse as you have seen it I've given one to you. I hope you're well and enjoyed with CD and don't forget to write back all about your news  during my summer holiday job.

Raul Pedro Ybarra S  [SEP]  Since the man become man he has had the need of hunting for sourvive, in ancient times he used spears, bows and arrows, and the wemon's role was to collect items like vegetables and stuff. Nowadays in the year 2000 we still practice this ancient art but in a diferent way, we don't use weapons for hunting animal in the jungle, we use the remote to hunt TV shows, and we do not collect vegetables any more we go shopping. This activity of shopping has become one of our most important, after all, we go shopping for any reason, we have develop such an instinc for shopping that we can proudly say, that we are some sort of kings in the urban jungle. If an activity has stay with us, the mankind, for so long, it must give us some pleasure and maybe that's why shopping has become such an important thing in our lives because it gives you pleasure when you find what you have been looking for and if you can get it for less than the price mark on it, that is the greatest  extasis. But where is the bad poet of it, well shopping can became horrible in christmast for example when houndred of people goes to the shopping center and it also can take many problems when you become an impulsive buyer. Any ways shopping is with us and it will stay with us for a long time. ",26.0

I am afraid I can only make it on July, because I am taking exams this month. Moreover, I'll prepare everything for going to University on August. I have no time until Christmas. So, I think the best time is July. The accommodation I prefer is  tent. I haven't tied it before. I would like to know how interesting it is to live in tents. If I can only choose two activities while I am at the Camp, I would like climbing and Basketball. I started climbing since I was a child. I love it very much. About the Basketball, I have been played it for seven years. I would like to play basketball with local people at the Camp to see how good they are, if I can. Finally, may I ask  some more informations. What kinds of clothes shall I take? how about the weather there? Would you give me some pocket-money during the trip. Also, may I take a friend with me, how much will she pay? I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely, JIA LI LO  [SEP]  To: Teacher Cheng From: Jia Lo Date: 13/06/00 Subject: a short video about daily life at school As I was asked, I spoke to a number of students about their opinions of this short video. I found that most of them had suggested that four lessons should be filmed which  as follow: 1. Grammer, which is the base of learning English. 2. Speaking, it makes you more confident when you talk with other peoper. Let you do more pratices. 3. Listening, it  really helpful for improving your listening and understanding. 4. Writing, this lesson techer you how to organise what you want to write. Also, there are two activities  should be filmed. 1. Students are talking to each other when they are having  break. It is important to pratise your English after lessons. 2. Teacher are helping students with their problems. If you have  problem on studing,  asking  teachers  is the best way . In Conclusion, the short video is only 60 minutes. It must show the daily lifes of the English students at the school. It should include all those points lists above. ",25.0
413," Dear Sir, I am writing to you to complain about the musical show ""Over the Rainbow"" which I went to see last week. First of all, the actors that played  the show were differents to Danny Brook and Tina Truelove. Besides of this they were not good as actors, so I am quite disappointed. Then, the show had to start at half past seven and I had to wait fourty-five minutes because it started later. But it is not all because in the advertisement  appeared the possibility of discounts  available and it is false, I had to pay £20 for each ticket. Finally, I wanted to visit your theatre restaurant and have a good dinner after the show but it was impossible. The restaurant was closed because most of the employees was on holidays and there were not enough people to attend the demand. In conclusion, it was not the perfect evening that I expected, so I am therefore writing to ask for a full refund of the tickets. I will be looking forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, and now my best friend knows that I will go to visit her next week. Alice is my best friend and we met twenty years ago. We went to the same school and we had the same hobbies. It was perfect because we always were together and doing interesting activities like snow board. One day her mother died and she had to move to Germany where her sister was living. But she was very sad because she knew that it will be very difficult  to see eachother in the future. After that, we wrote letters and she phoned me once time a week but it wasn't the same. I couldn't explain all my problems to her and her voice had changed. Finally, I decided to visit her but I wanted that it was a surprise. I worked hard during one month and I could save  money to buy a ticket for the plane. I decided to explain all my plans to Pat and she promised me that she didn't say anything but it wasn't true. Yesterday she phoned to Alice and explained all. In spite of this I am very happy because I know that Alice is preparing many activities  to do together and  to spend the best week in our lifes.

Yours faithfully Javi Fernández  [SEP]  Why don't you buy the green one? Oh, no! That's horrible, mum! This is one of a normal scene when a mother and her daughter are buying and getting clothes from the shelves. That is what most of the women love. They love going to a shopping centre and put lots of clothes on. That's so good when you have  money for joy it but, appart from that, there are many problems. On the one hand, a big problem are the children. When they go to shopping with their mothers, they want to buy all the things that their sight reach: doors, little cars, films... but, when their mothers see a good thing that they want to buy, there are the children: crying because they are tired for shopping all the day. On the other hand there is a big problem: the mony. People buy and buy unnecessary things but, when they arrives in their houses, they can see an empty wallet. So, do you believe that a shopping bag like this one is an enjoyable shopping day? ",24.0
160," Dear Sir/Madam I am writing to make a complaint about the Circle Theatre. I recently went there to see the musical show ""Over the Rainbow"". I was very disapointed to find out that most of the things said in the advertisement for the show were not true. For example, the advertisement said that Danny Brook would be the lead actor, but he was not. Instead, there was this unknown actor with a very bad performance and  a terribly annoying voice. Moreover, the play did not start at the time it was supposed to. I had to wait for forty five minutes. All the waiting made me quite hungry, so I was expecting to have good meal at the theatre restaurant after the show. However, it was closed for cleaning. All these problems spoiled my evening and frustrated me, since I was expecting to see a good play, so I expect a full refund. By the way, why weren't any discounts available for the tickets, as it was said in the advertisement? I look forward to hearing from you and having my money back. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  The New Modern Life Modern technology and science have changed my life in many ways. The easy access to information and the new ways of communicating with other people help me save time that I can spend doing whatever I want to. Of all the recent technological advances, the one that had the great impact on my life was the Internet. It provides you  all the information you want. I don't watch the news on television anymore, because I can use my computer to read only the things that interest me. Mobile phones are another thing that is making my life much easier. They allow you to talk to other people no matter where you are. This can be very useful when you have a problem that needs an immediate solution. All these things save me lots of time. I get to rest more and spend more time at home, and so they make me a happier person. For the next  years, we can expect many more technologies that will continue making our lives easier. ",33.0
957," Dear Mrs Ryan, Thanks for your letter. I have reading the letter and I was very surprised that I have won the first prize. About the time when I like to travel is only July, because in the summer is it very busy at work. People where I working with they are going on holiday in Juni and August. So hey need me at work in that months. Further the accomodation I  prefer at Camp California is the log cabin. Because, at first when I was a little child we were staying every holiday in a small house and I like that. At second, I don't like tents and I don't get used to it, so I prefer log cabins. About the different activities we like them all, but If I choose two I take sailing and tennis. In the summer I'm sailing  races almost every weekend and I have my own sailing clothes. I'm not very good in Tennis but I can practise on my travel. Finally, I have one question about the money. Which things I must paid for on my travel? Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Kim, Thanks for your letter. How are you? With me is everything fine and the pop concert was great. I enjoyed helping at the popconcert, but it's very stressful work. You always walk from side to side to move things and there's no break. Some other work what I have done was to lead the people to there places. We have worked the whole day and luckily at least we had some food. The most beautiful things were that we saw famous singers and I spoke with Robbie Williams. He's friendly and very handsome off course. If you see the famous singers in reality they are different and the most singers they haven't time for you. Another thing I have done was the make up  only for about fifteen minutes. That was very nice, because I didn't expected that. There were some people they gave me some advise  to clean the face and etc. Finally, it was a very nice day with great experience. Loves ",23.0
617," Dear Mrs Ryan It was a grate pleasure to hearing from you, that I have won first prize in your competition. I am very glad that all accommodation and travel costs are paid, but even though I would like to know how much money do I have to take with me. I would be glad to travel only in July because of family reasons. Other point is accommodation. I would be more than happy if you could have provided me with  tent. The reasons as following;  better relationship with nature, and  grate opportunity to improve my health. Also I would like to tell you which activities I would like to chose and why. I like swimming and photography because it will be very interesting to improve my skills at both activities. The last thing I would like to know is which clothes do I have to take, even though the weathe in July will be good. Yours sincerely.  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable. Almost all of us like shopping! Going in and out of the shops, buying clothes, food and presents, but a few of us who is very happy to spend money. Money is a very important thing in shopping, if you have money,  is not a problem, but if you don't? So, let's imagen that your credit card is not working, or some one stold your cash from your pocket. We will say  unlucky, but no one will help you in that situation. Also it is very difficult to shop if you are handicapt. Staying in a que or croude is also unplesent. All  people are shouting, stepping on your feet and it is very likely that you won't get the product you need. After words you are tiered and have no power to do things. After all  things that I have mentioned it is clearly seen that shopping is not enjoyable. ",24.0
824," Dear Mrs Ryan I am writing in connection with the competition I entered a month ago. I received your letter, and I was delighted to know that I won it. As requested, below are some further information and some enquiries. I would be able to travel only after the end of my exams which are taking place in June. So, I think that July would suit me best. As far as accomodation is concerned, I would prefer sleeping in a tents. I have been travelling every summer since I was eighteen years of age and this type of accomodation is part of the ritual. I would enjoy a lot playing tennis because it is a sport I love and I am really good in it. In addition I would love to follow the photography classes eventhough I have never tried to take a picture before. I hope I gave you all the information you needed. From my part, I would just like to know what sort of clothes should I bring with me and also how much money. Thanking you in advance, I am looking forward to your prompt respons to my enquiries Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Kim I got your letter yesterday and I was really glad to hear from you... it's been ages since you last wrote to me! I've done so many thinks and between them I went to Glastonbery (as you know)! It lasted three days and I've had the best fun of my life. I went as a voluntier staff in order to go for free. I had to help the Green Peace teems to recycle everything we could. We were more or less two hundred students doing the same job. Our duty was to work eight ours each day and then we were free to enjoy the rest of the day as we liked. The accomodation and the food were part of the contract... everything free. They provided us  tents and also a VIP pass in order to get food. Oh my God!!! It has been the best experience you can Imagine. I met lots of nice and cool people, and what I most enjoyed was the crazy atmospher of the hole thing. No matter how hard we had to work, everyone had always humor and  a positive mood. So, I'll sign off now and I hope you'll write soon. Lots of love Irene ",28.0
954," Dear Mrs. Ryan, I'm writing  you replying to your letter asking for some more information about me, to give you all the information you need. First of all you asked when would I be able to travel. You ought to know that  is possible to me to go there only in July because I'm going to work the whole  August. Answering the second question I would prefer my accomodation  in log cabins. The reason is that, in my opinion, they are more comfortable, there's more space and in addition they are warmer. Providing that you give me the chance to chose two activities I would love to do swimming and singing. I attend to swimming and singing classes twice a week so I'm really good at both. Finally I would like to ask you about clothes and money. Where will we be able to wash our clothes during the camp? Are we allowed to carry with  all the money we wish to? Don't hesitate to contact me for any more question. Yours sincerely, Angeles.  [SEP]  Nowadays shopping is considered one of the most usual and enjoyable activities, especially if you are a woman and you are out to buy clothes. At first sight it is, but shopping is not always enjoyable. Basing my opinion on my experience I'm going to talk mostly about clothes shopping. There are some points that give me the reason. First of all, who is your companion? If you take  mum shopping the right day she has been all day doing housework, that will probably end in discussion. In one hand, there's you. You are feeling sick,  angry with your boyfriend. How do you pretend to see in a mirror that anything fits well on you? In the other, you have always to count on unfriendly shop assistants, no   size for you or too high prices. Who would talk now about enjoyable shopping journeys? I'm sure there would be plenty of people ready to do it. ",30.0
1131," Dear Principal, First of all, we would like to thank you for  good programme which provides us  3 days stay in London.  It contains a wide range of activities for example, sightseeing,  river trip, visiting  science museum and gallery, shopping.  It is certain that the programme will give the students considerable enjoyment. However, we have found an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure show, which will be held at Central Exhibition Hall on 14th of March.  The advertisement says that the show is full of many interesting programmes, such as the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles etc.  Moreover, students are allowed to admit for free. All of us would like to attend the show because young people, particularly girls are interested in fashion and make up, so we are expecting the show will be the great opportunity to see what the new trend in fashion will be like. It would be grateful if you give a little change in  programme so that we are able to attend the show.  It seems to be good to change the programme of 14th into the London Fashion and Leisure show, instead of the science museum and shopping.  I am looking forward to hearing from you.  [SEP]  Technical and Warm Home People's way of life has considerably been changed by rapdily developing mordern technology.  To begin with, it will be good to look back on how our parents have lived in a house. 50 years ago, Korean mothers should have made a fire by burning woods to warm a room up and make food.  Since the eletric fire and microwave oven had been invented, their life have been far easier than before. Today, however, people do not need to spend many times on making food, washing up, or even on turning on an off the light.  Machines, such as a dish washer, laundry machine and remote controller help us jut to relax or do a little work necessary. From my point of view, people's home in the future will be controlled by a computer which is devised in every machine, TV, cooker and the light, connecting to the owner.  He/she can just press the button or send e-mail to operate what he/she needs, even though the owner is far from the house. On the other hand, people will still be living in a building which is constructed for a ""family"".  In spite of the computer, children will need food their mothers make and love expressed not by a computer, but by parents themselves. Computer might know better than  human, but there are many things which it can not replace in our life. ",32.00

I would like to travel as soon as possible because now I am on holiday. My holidays will finish in the begining of September and  will be good to travel during this time. (August-September). The accommodation I would prefer to stay in   tents because I like adventures and also I will have more contact with the nature. For the time that I will spend there I would like to chose more the two activities but I know  is not possible so I chose swimming and singing. I usualy sing in my spare time and my friends love  when I sing and about swimming I was champion last year in my city. So, I am quite good. I would like to ask you some questions like which kind of clothes  I have to go with ? Will I need to go with how much money? Is necessery tablets (for headach, insects)? Can I go with a friend? Thank you for your attention. I am looking forward to hearing from you soon. yours sincerely  [SEP]  Introduction This report is going to give us ideas about which lessons and other activities should be filmed in our daily life at school. Why to film the school? Firstly we should film our school to show how important it is for our growing. Secondly, parts of our life like breaks, lunch time, spending time with friends will be good to make the video interesting. Suggesting places to film. A good place to be filmed is our Geography class. The students in this class have lots of freedom to speak and we can travel around the world in one hour and fifteen minutes. Is wonderfull how the tecnology make things so easy. Also we should film our sports class because with this we will show how important  is to be healthy nowadays. Conclusion To conclude we could film our teachers life too. Will be great because teachers are part of our life and they have to receive all our attention and friendship because if are not them we will never grow and learn how to live our lives more confidents and with lots of good experiences that we will never forget.

21," Dear Ms Clark, I write you this letter because I want to tell you  my experiences of the festival. I have spent two days at the ""International Arts Festival"" and I have to say that it was a good event but I think some details could be better the next time. For example, on the leaflet it was written that there will be stars and artists from around the world but they were only from six different countries. That was disappointing! Some concert halls were really small so that there was bad air and not enough place for everyone and you could not enjoy anything! What about plays and films? It was a small offer; I hope it will be larger the next time. But do not worry! There have also taken place very good attractions like  dance shows, the art exhibition and listening to  talks  by writers, The reasonably-priced weekend ticket was a very good idea. This was a clever way to attract people's attention At last, I would like suggest a ""pony-ride"" for children, to attract families. Please tell my your opinion about this. Best regards  [SEP]  I think there are some possibilities for earning money. I would say the simplest way is to give lessons to pupils, for example,  maths or english. There are also some schools which offer such a job. To teach pupils is not easy, of course. But I think that after some lessons the pupils will see that it is better if they sit down and learn their stuff. So it would be easier for the teacher ! It is also not a dirty work, I mean you do not have to clean rooms or toilets of other people! And you do not need to carry heavy things or have stress with customers if you are working in a shop. To be a good teacher you especially need patient and good nerves! Not everybody has the ability to understand everything at once. And the money you get is not less So, if you like to b with people and help them and if you have  talent to explain  good then it would be the best, if you offer your help to the people! ",25.00

I am very looking forward to going to California and I would like to go in July, because I am going to have my summer holidays in that month. About accommodation, I would prefer  log cabins, because I have a problem in my back. Therefore, I need to sleep in a bed. Also tents are not fairly comfortable. As far as camp activities  concerned, I have been doing windsurfing for 5 years , for that reason, I am fairly interested in sailing. On the other hand, I  keen on painting, however, I have never painted in my life, so I would like to try it. Finally, I was wondering what kind of clothes I have to wear in California? In addition, could you advice me how much money I need for the trip? and is there anything else do I have to know? I look forward to hearing from you.

I went to Madrid last week and I was walking in the street when somebody asked me  an address. I looked at him and I realised that this person was David Bowie. Yes!!! I couldn't believe it. He was trying to speak in Spanish, but his accent was terrible. So, I started to speak in English with him. I explained to him where was the street that he was looking for and we carried out with the conversation for a while. I thought he was very rude, but I was wrong, he isn't arrogant at all and he looks very simply. I liked my experience with him and I think the best part was when he gave me his e-mail address. Yeah!!! I'm not joking, I got his e-mail. Well my friend, I have to go, because I  got an appoinment with the Dentist. Write  me soon and take care. Best wishes ",22.0
762," Dear Helen Ryan Thank you very much for the prize  two weeks at Camp California in the USA. On the following there is some further information from me. I would like to travel only in July, because I have so many assignments to finish before the end of June. I do not think I have enough time to prepare somethings to travel before of July. In fact, I really do not mind to stay in log cabins, but I have never stayed in a tent before. I think its might be fun to try to stay in the tent this time. I would prefer to choose tennis and swimming. I used to be a tennis player when I was fifteen. I won first prize two years ago. The other activity is swimming. I started to learnt when I was five years old. I was a swimming teacher for a year in a sports club. Now I own a swimming school and have trained the staffs every week. I think both activities I have chosen are suitable for me and I am sure I can do well. What type of clothes I should bring with me? and is there any equipment I need to bring with me. I would like to know how much money I need to spend during a camping. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely (Mali Ratana)  [SEP]  13th July 2000 Dear Kim Thank you very much for your letter that I just got last week. How are you? I hope you have a nice summer time now. I wondered who had told you about I had helped  a pop concert last month. Anyway, it is doesn't matter now who had told you, but I was very happy and enjoyed it. Well, I am going to tell you about it. First of all, I had to been train by the concert's staff for a day. Before the concert started I had to help the staff prepared a stage,  like put the instruments where they should be on the stage,. And then, I had to help the singer to do some make up. I was very frightening I might put too much make up on their faces, but everything was allright. After that, I had to help them to prepare some lunch when the concert had started. I was running around to find something I could do, like serving some drinks for  staffs or the singers. After the concert finished I had to help them cleaned up everything. I was so tired, but enjoyed. I really like to help people without  something back. This experience I was so prond  and very enjoyed. I think I didn't waste my time at all. I spent my free time to helping them  its made my life a little bit busy. I think I have learnt a lot from this experience. To helping people you should not expect anything back to you, except happiness and enjoyable. Well, I think I must stop writing now. I hope you are enjoying with my experience. I hope to see you sometime next month. Love ",26.0
192," Dear Sir, I am writing to complain about a musical show presented in your theatre. Indeed, I recently spent a week's holiday in London and I went to the theatre to see ""Over the Rainbow"". It was really a very disappointing evening. I was disappointed to see that Danny Brook, announced on your advertisement, did not act in this show. Indeed, he was replaced by a different actor for this evening. Additionally, the show started at 20:15 instead of 19:30, and I had to pay the full price for my ticket as no discount was available. However, the worst was to come as it was impossible to eat something after the show. Indeed, the theatre restaurant was closed because the chef was ill. I hope you can imagine my great disappointment. Therefore, I would like to ask you for refunding me my entrance fee, as this evening did not correspond to your advertisement. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Science and technology have played an important role for the last twenty years and the development of the modern technology has especially affected our lives. To take my personal example, I would be no more able to live without some of the most recent discoveries, which make my daily life easier. For instance, I can't imagine living without using a computer to write my scholar works, to play a game or to order some goods on the Internet. This latter is a new media which has changed my life, as it is a marvellous tool  to communicate, learn or have fun. Another important change related to the modern technology are the credit cards. Until I have had one, I was often run out of cash and had to go to the bank. At the present time, thanks to my credit card, I can really buy what I want, when I want and where I want! To sum up, there are many other discoveries in relation with the modern technology which affect my daily life. However it would be too long to list them all, and I am quite sure that you also know them as they don't change only my life, but everybody's daily life. ",29.0

Next week I will be start organising some events for this conference. The event will organize at the Palace Hotel. The same hotel that will you stay . Palace Hotel is opposite the park `Clifton', which is near the college. We chose that hotel because is it near the college and we don't need to use a transport. Because you know where is the college and you need to bring with me some things at the college to  hotel I think that  is better  to come all the group in  college and then we can go all together to the `Palace Hotel'. The conference start at 9:00 o'clock you need to be at the college half an hour before. Concerning the end-of-conference  I'm thinking about some dance and singing events. Tell me your idea. About the clothes that we need to wear,  must be  uniform, because  is the best conference to London and every year are coming lectures from other colleges. Finally on the last day we have organised a seeing-crossing around London. You will have the opportunity  visiting some museums and  zoo parks. I think it is a nice idea. If you want more information you can call me my telephone number is 047***. Please if you have  more ideas send me a letter. Yours Sincerely,  [SEP]  Nowdays all the people have a telephone.

Especial if some of your relatives or friends are living in other country you can communicate with them and everyday and you don't feel that they are far a way from you.

Also you can leave a message if you call and can't find someone. The last type of telephone, is the mobile phone. You can use it everywhere and at anytime. Finally  telephone except|apart from   type of communication, is  type and socialisation. Nowadays who are so bussy and we don't have free time to see our friends,  we can call them and talk or chat with them. Especial the young people are using many hours  the telephone and that is trouble for their parents.

During our stay we saw a bright advertisement of your theatre and decided to see this newest and best musical show (as it was said in you advertisement). Actually. I must say that  our perfect evening wasn't out! In your ad  was said that in  main roles  would be Danny Brook and Tina Truelove. Danny wasn't there! Instead there was a different actor whose play was disappointing. The show had to begin at 19.30, but indeed it started at 20.15 and we had to wait for 45 minutes in a great noise. Some words about  tickets: you ad noticed that discounts were available so we didn't have  money with us. When we came the administration of the theatre said that discounts are not available. Finally, when we decided to visit your theatre restaurant after the show it was closed (all the staff went home because the show lasted 45 minutes longer). For all these reasons I would like you to give me at least half of my money back. With hope for a mutual agreement, Mrs. (...).  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. It was May, 15 - our english teacher's birthday. Marion was our favourite school teacher and we decided to make a surprise for her. Month ago we began to prepare for this day and we all agreed to keep it in a secret. We have been discussing for a long time what to present her. There were a lot of proposals from the students: one proposed a vase, another - a good pen (he said it would be useful for the teacher). But we decided to buy a picture, because she has always told us about art galleries with a great exitement. We have chosen the best one with a beautiful nature  in it. We also decided to arrange a party on her birthday (and it had to be a surprise too). A day before her birthday we had an English lesson, and after the lesson Pat came up to Marion and told her about our surprise. He was bad-tempered and envious and he didn't want everything to be all right, and besides he didn't like Marion. That's why he disappointed Marion and us. ",26.0

My two  activities's choices are Climbing and Surfing. I used to climb and I want to try  still because climbing is good for the fit. I want to do surfing too because I like snowboarding and I think surfing make similar sensations, but I have never practised that sport. I have one question to ask you.

When you mentioned the period of my travelling I'm afraid I  only free in July. Because I go on holiday in July naturally, and I have two terms in June and August. Therefore, I hope that you could make  suitable arguement between you and me. Furthermore, I would like to stay in log cabins which I could feel  more American style of the accommodation. In addition, there should not  too hot inside during July. If I get two choices, I would like to go swimming and take photographs. Because I grew up in my home town that is a seaside city. I was starting trainning since 1996, and I have never give it up. Esepically, it is really good for my healthy during the growth period. Photography is my hobby that is taken in my spare time. I can remember that I used to take photographs on the exhibitions or during the holidays. It must be nice for my memories when I am older. In addition, it could showed people how nice the places  are and the views I have got. Therefore, I would like to do those two activities. Finally, I would like to know  the weather in California. Do I need take too much clothes? Could you tell me that the amount of money I can bring during the holiday? I look forward to hearing from you! Your sincerely SHE DUNES  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable Shopping is concerned that people exchange from money to their demands. There are more and more retailors are opening to customer. Therefore, people used to shopping weekly or monthly. In my opinion, women are really enjoying shopping. It seems a human activity during their spare time. However, we are going to change  traditional system to the ""e-shopping"". It is new for customers by technology they can switch on the computer and click everything they want. Therefore, it looks like a service and  also boring for  customer. I think most of gentlemen dislike shopping. They are always waiting for a long time after women finish their shopping. I believed that most of busy people want go shopping by the easy and quick way. Because they don't like waiting for payment and waste time of life. Therefore, they would like to use ""e-shopping"" which is getting better for their time. The life style has change already from  past. Shopping is  common activity in their life. We must focus on the specific life style, which will make us enjoyable.  In conclusion, I believe that shopping only waste time for human life. And you couldn't get back any more. ",20.0

I went to the theatre to see at what time was the show, 19.30, it was O.K. so I bought a ticket. In that moment my problems began. I couldn't get any discount; that mean, that the advertisement was wrong, but I bought the ticket anyway. Then I had to wait 45 mins, the show started at 20:15. Then Danny Brook wasn't acting, it was a different actor. In that moment I was realy angry, so to calm down I went to the theatre restaurant, but it was closed, because of its bad cleaning and food. That was too much. ""Dear"" manager I hope you to understand me, so I ask for money back and I hope this wont happen again. By  [SEP]  First of all I think we have grown  with the technology. It's difficult for us to realize the changes in our live, but we can think about it. How has it change my daily life? Well, in one word it made my life comfortabler. Now I only used to push a button, and things or mashines work on their own. Homework is easer to find in the cumputer than in a book sometimes. Everything is faster, and sometimes technology go so fast that I'm unable to follow it. Modern technology showed us that we could do anything we wanted to, and it make us thing more about my future job. Maybe, I won't be able to understand how the things worked and that scare me, I will be useless, because a mashine will do all the work. ",26.0
992," Dear Helen Ryan; I have just received your letter which is made me so hapy. I can not belive that I won first prize in your competition, because I always belived I am an unluky man and now I think somethings are changing in my life. I would like to come in July, because I am studying English and we have  one month break at July, so please make my log cabin ready by july. I  prefer stay in  cabin because I have some experience with tents from my childhood and it was not  very good experience therefore I would like to stay in  cabin. You saying in your letter I could do two activities from the list which is show many exciting activities. I will definitly chose Basketball and Swimming wich are the my dream sport. I used to be play in  school team when I was in high school and our team was the one of the best Basketball team in  all county and I  also very good at swim. I would like to ask a few things, specialy  wheather: how is the weather  in July in the U.S.A. What kind of clothes I will need and how much money I should take with me, Because I have never been   U.S.A. before and I don't know anything  I am looking forward to your reply letter. Your sincerely  [SEP]  I have never enjoyed doing shopping, but nowday  some people  are calling shopcholic. They are just like alcholics and this people are every day doing shopping because they can not stop themself unless they have not got money for spend. I can not believe how they doing this things every day, even when I need something at home I alway try to find out something to use instead of that things. Because nowdays whereever you go there is  big queue and I hate being waited. The queue is not only the problem if you go by car there is  parking problem, if you go by bus there is again queue and you have to carry many carry bag carrier bags during the your journey and you won't be alway luky  to find a seat to seat. If you go shopping for (buy) clothes that is the worse kind of shopping. Specialy if you want to buy  with your girlfriend or if you are already  girl you have to be read for hours to spend try on and off. I realy hate go shopping with girls to buy clothes because when they went into a shop they want try on every single cloth and they do not realise to time. Some people says ""shopping is not alway enjoyable"" but for me   definity unenjoyable and I think it will be  same   rest of my life. ",19.0
930," Helen Ryan Competitor Organiser Dear Helen, I am writing to you in replay to the letter I have recently recived, to inform you about some details that I am concerned about. First of all I want you to know that I would prefer to travel in July due to the exam I will be taking in June and, afterwards, I will start my university studies in September which means  lots of things to be sorted out. Secondly, I prefer staying in log cabins because it is easyer for me to keep my personal belongings clean and tidy apart from the fact that I am terribly afraid of insects such as spiders and ants. In your letter you settled the possibility  to choose two activities and I would like to let you know that I would be pleased if I could join to basketball and climbing, as I am very good at both of them due to I've played  in my secondary scholl as leader of my team and due to my long training periods in lifting weights. Lastly, do I need to take with me any special staff of clothes? Do I need some money? and if it is so, how much? I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable Suppose you go shopping with your girlfriend, that means that you will have to spend hours walking behind her from one shop to another and during the time that she is trying the items on, you have to bear with the odds faces of the other women looking at you as if you were an alien into their territory. There is as well the struggle you have to endure when you find yourself into the crowds crambled in the small shops during the unique day-off you have to buy somthing you like. All this can easily leads to a nerve-collapse, particularly when you realise that your money has been stolen either during your difficult way across the crowds or while you were qeuing to pay. If this wasn't enough you strength and mental health can be completely destroyed when despite having been stolen, having spent hours walking around and being tired and hungry you finally buy something you really liked with your credit card and after having walked a few blocks you see the same item at half  price in another shop.

932," Dear Mrs Helen Ryan, I am very happy to have won the first prize of the competition, and I am going to clear up some details you asked me  in your letter. Firstly, because of my school exam, I would like to travel only  july. Moroever, I have chosen this month because I think the weather will be fine. At Camp California, I hope I will be in  tents because I like very much this kind of style life: I love the contact with the nature. On the other handDuring my stay in Camp California, I want to go swimming because I practice this activitie regularly and I often do competitions: this is one of my hobbies. In addition to this, I wish I am going to sail: I have never try it, but it seems to be great! Finally, I have two questions more: I wonder if I can change my french money in the Camp and what kind of clothes I have to buy before coming? Yours sincerely. Didier Bovie  [SEP]  Dear Kim, As you asked me in your last letter, I am going to tell you more about the last month's pop concert. Firstly, I arrived five hours before the begining of the concert in order to help the musicians to move the material from the van to the scene. As soon as all the conections was made, we tested the nivel of the sound: I found it too loud, so I advised them to regular it, and they listed to me! Then, there was only one hour left to install the differents color lights: it was just enought time. Thus, it was a fantastic afternoon because I like very much music, even if I don't play any music instrument. Moreover, I learnt a lot about music, especially concerning the way of using an instrument. Consequently, I hope I will play an instrument in the future, especially because the group promises me to help me to learn any instrument. See you soon. Best wishes Didier Bovie ",27.0
998," Dear Sir/Madam, Thank you very much. I am very glad I have won first prize in the competition - two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. I would like to travel only in July, because in June I have to study at school which hasn't finished until the end of June. In August, I have already made another appointment with my friends. We are going to visit the places of interest of China, as usual, our new term begins in September. I only can travel in July Accommodation I would prefer in tents to in log cabins. Tents are very easy to take and  go everywhere. What's more, in my opinion it is very romantic. I am good at singing and photography. I can sing most kinds of songs, such as pop music, folk. I like taking photograph, in my only room. There are all kinds of photos, for example,  beach, sea trees and so on. In the end, I wonder what kind of clothes I should take and how much money I should bring with me. I look forward to seeing you soon. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  To: Mrs Flame From: Kate Subject: which lessons and other activities should be filmed Instruction: The aim of this report is to suggest which lessons and lessons  be filmed into a short video. In order to write the report I interviewed about one hundred students who are studying in our English class. Results: The majority of them said it's a good idea to make something about Maths and English study skills. Sixty percent recommended that the activity which called make the brain up in the morning class should be filmed. Ten of them said  should make the computing. Two thirds said we should film a part of playing football. Reasons: Although Maths is very boring, it is very important in nowadays. English is the most popular language in the world, what's more, more and more people start to learn English. The activity of making brain up can help us remember new words. Playing football is good for  health. Conclusion: It is recommended that  should be filmed about Maths, English study skills,make brain up and a part of playing football. ",26.0
545," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to giving  information about myself. Even though I would like to travel, I am only  in July, because I am a high school student. Thus I have not got  long holiday. I just have one month left. Personally, I would rather stay in log cabins than in tents. On accound  to stay in log cabins are as much more interesting than  in tents. As far as two activities are concerned I would choose singing and photography. I used to win a number of competitions in singing. I can sing a plenty of songs. which include the english song and the japenese song, and I have  part-time job for sining at  restaurant. Although the photography is not as good as the singing, I am very interested in it. I have been learning  since I was 15 year old. I got third prize in it competition last year and I level is professional now. Futermore, I am going to have  competition next year. I would like to asking  some information about that what kind of clothes I have to wearing and how many your are charge. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable, sometimes have a long quare or a mechine was broken. A lot of circumsenses will have been happening. I have  unpleased experience. It was in lunch time. Everybody were went to by luch in  supermarket, in fact, nobody liked crowe and quare, expecially  in the summer time. I was quare in the middle of row. I choose this row because I though it was quicker than  other. Although there were finished two people, next was me, something was happened. Suddenly the customer though the receipt was not truth, she did not buy a lot of things but the shop assistant did not make  mistake, they argued about this thing. The shop manager was coming solution it. Abviously, I have to chance other row. I was long quare, I have never had. Shopping would be enjoyable, if you were good luck. Even though I think it most of time is very interesting, sometimes  make people upsent. ",14.0
933," Dear Mrs. Ryan, I received your letter last monday. I want to say thank you that I was the lucky person who won that competition. It will be a great opportunity for me to see the United States and I am so happy about that, I can not explain it. You want to know some further information from me. About the date, when I want to travel can I say that it is only possible for me on July because I have to do some exams at the school. I would prefer to the accommodation at the camp a tent, the reason is that I like to live realy natural and it is more enjoyable to live in a tent then in  cabins. As activities I can say that I like every sport, but basketball and tennis would be perfect for me. In basketball I have  more practise then in tennis. I play every weekend on competitions with my local team and about tennis it is that I tried but it is not like my basketball experience. Also I want to know how much clothes and  money I would need for these two weeks. Please write  me  your answer as quick as possible. I hope I can hear from you soon. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Kim, How are you my lovely penfriend? I hope good. You want to know how was it to work and help at a pop concert? It is marvelous. You see the stars so near and also you can chat with them. On my first day I should help to bring the staff for the band, things like guitars, drums and others. It was maybe hard work for a while but I was so happy about that to help on a real big pop concert I can't decribe it. On the other two days I helped to prepare the breakfast, lunch and diner for the band. You are always so near to these people and after a while it is normal to stay and chat with Brian Adams, for example. I realy enjoyed that and it was one of the greatest, when not the greatest experience in my life. On the other hand it was a good paid job with 15 pounds per hour, what do you can say. The organizer of the tournement have spoken with me and asked me if I want I could do the same work in two months at the concert by the Rolling Stones is that not fantastic. I couldn't believe it but he gave me the contract to fill it out. I hope Kim you was not too jealous about that, sorry. Please write  me soon, I'm waiting. Loves ",28.0
687," Dear Competition Organiser: I'm so happy and exciting to receive this letter about  I've won the first prize in your competition. I've been dreaming  to travel to  U.S.A for so many years. The dream happens to me now. So I shall think about it carefully and make everything ready! I would like to travel in July because I have to go back to my country in Auguest. And I'm sure about that the weather in July will be lovely! I prefer living in tents to living in log cabins. I think living in tents is more comfortable for sleeping. Also I am not very keen on sleeping with too many people in the same place. Basket ball is my favourite sporting. It's one of the most popular sports in  U.S.A as well in my opinion. And I was school-team player when I was in High school. So I am good at it. The other thing I would like to do is sailing. But I never try it before. I just think it will be exciting and interesting for me. Maybe I can't manage it! Also I got two questions to ask you. The first one is that shall I take a lot of money or just a little? And the last one is that do I need pillow or blanket or something else? I hope that I will enjoy my journey! Yours Sincerely  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable  More and more people like shopping now. You can see so many people walk along the business street every day and any time, especially in Oxford Street. Sometimes shopping can relax people and increase people's working express. But is it always enjoyable? Of course not. The most obvious example is that when you're shopping in the shop you're not sure which one you are going to buy, you turn to the people who sell them, but they sometimes ignore you. So you like them but you don't want them any more. It makes you angry! Also for example. you really like some shoes or clothes, when you want to buy them, someone tell you ""I'm sorry, this one is sold out""! What a pity! You become unhappy immediately. And sometimes for example, you just bought something last week, but when you go shopping this week, you see the same items but different prices, maybe from £50 down to £20, and then you'll regret wasting money, although you like it very much. If you were  rich man it doesn't mater, but if you were  poor man, you will be sad! How can shopping be enjoyable at thoese situation! So I think shopping is not always enjoyable! ",27.0
853," Tito Torres Vargas ELIZABETH GASKELL COLLEGE Manchester, UK Helen Ryan Competition Organizer Dear Madam, Thank you for this great opportunity to travel with you for free! I entered the competition you organized but never expected to be the lucky winner. I could only travel on the first week of July because I have to join my parents on their trip to Italy, due to start on the 20th. The accomodation that best suits me is in log cabins, as the space in tents is very limited and I am not used to have all my belongings in order and packed at all times. In respect of the activities you offer, it is difficult to choose in such a hugh variety, but I prefer to do those I better know  as climbing. I've been studying Photography on my own, and I am looking forward to practise new techniques and take pictures of new landscapes. Please send me a list of the items I many need there, including the most appropriate clothes for the american weather. I would also like to know in advance the amount of money I need to bring for expenses that will not be included. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable Most of us would agree on that. Who has never had a bad experience related with an unsatisfactory product? Moreover, who has the freedom to buy with an unlimited budget whatever they need? And finally who has all the time needed to do so? There are many things that can go wrong in the process of adquiring a product or service. And whenever money is involved, some problems are likely to happen. Thieves will try to put their hands in our wallets and purses, and even the so called 'plastic money' is not always safe. Hunting on the High Street, or the Shopping Malls, for the desired bargain - because we cant afford otherwise to buy  - becomes often a desperate atempt to reach a living promoted by the new consuming society. And nobody can say they would rather go back to the caverns' age where money was not even invented. With more free time and more money to spend than ever, shopping is a great activity, but when this creates bad habits  as overspending,  could lead to serious problems. At the end all depends in our attitud to life, including shopping. I particularly enjoy making lists of the products  before going shopping. But even without money to spend  is fun to rush from time to time in the sales that seasonaly appear, or simply look at the superb displays that shops have in their showrooms. Shopping may be enjoyable or not at all! ",40.0
1063," Wawsaw, 12th December 2000 Dear Mr Robertson, First of all, we would like to thank you very much for organising such a wonderfull trip with an interesting program. We are all extremely excited especially because of the trip to Greenwich, the town we were always interested in. However, there are may other interesting places and exhibitions to see in London. For example, in the time of our visit there is going to be ""The London Fashion and Leisure Show"". It is a coinsidence which we would be extremely happy to take advantage on. This is a great opportunity for us to see the latest fashions and famous fashion models who we would like to have authograps from. We hope changing the excursion program a little will not cause any problems. Our suggestion is to visit  Science Museum on Wednesday afternoon instead of Tuesday. Because the fashion show lasts a whole day long. We are ready to give up our shopping and Free time. The show starts on 14th March at 10.00 and ends at 19.00 the same day. We are sorry for any inconvenience caused by our request. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Famous people are living creatures. They breathe, eat, feel and beside  that they are famous they are just the same as anyone else. Nobody likes to be observed constantly or touched by strangers and pointed out in the streets with no right even or just a little privacy. I personally think the best  would be to put the celebrities in cages and let people touch them, point and ask for authopraps. Like in the zoo. The biggest commercial gain in history I believe, but celebrities are not animals although they may be sometimes treated the same way. On the other hand, they must have done something to become famous. It may in many cases, not be true but we can suspect that most of them wanted to become a celebrity and they had to know there is no private life unseparately contected to it. To sum up, I believe that everyone has the right to keep  privacy of their own homes and even someone extremely famous deserve to have a private life. Unfortunately as long as their private life is interesting for ordinary people and it brings commercial gain to publishers, journalists and photographers, famous people will just have to get use to this living ""under a microscope"".

235," Dear Sir or Madam I am writing to complain about the musical show which is called OVER THE RAINBOW. I saw the show on  17th of July. Firstly, the advertisement claimed  discount ticket was available. Although I have a student card for discounts I could not get any discount. So I had to buy a normal ticket. Secondly, I bought a second musical show ticket which start at 19:30 but it started at 20:15. As a result, I had to wait over one hour as I arrived there at 19:00. Thirdly, your advertisement misled I could see Danny Brook in the show who I adore. When I turned up  the show, there was another actor instead of him. Fourthly, after the show the theatre restaurant was closed because of it's problems. But I could go evening out. To sum up, I believe your advertisement completely misled . So I am fully entitled to ask for  refund except for evening out. I hope this matter will recieve your prompt attention. yours faithfully BO-PHAT SUN (MS)  [SEP]  Nowadays, mordern technology has increasingly been developing. We get many advantages which make improve our lives daily, on the other hands, we get also many disadvantages which could harm us. In my opinion, the main advantage is  developing of medical technology. For example, if you were hurt seriously like cutting  leg , the new medical technology could rebuilit part of your body. Another advantage is sharing information. The more developing the technology is, the quicker and easier international networking is. So at the same time many people can share some information even though they live in different country. In contrast, the technology can cause a pollution. By developing of transport, we can get wherever you want to go easily, however it could cause serious air pollution like acid-rain and smog. Also we should be careful as we could be watched by security carmera which has been combined with mordern technology. In conculsion, I conciderly said we has been charged by morder technology in two way. One is  advantage and the other is  disadvantage. And it will change our lives, also in the future. ",23.0
531," To the manger of the Circle Theatre Mr Smith Caen, Saturday June 17th Mr Smith, I have recently been to London on a holiday trip so I decided to spend my free-time going to the musical show you were advertising for. It seemed very attractive and the different informations on the ad pushed me into going to it. Unfortunately, I've been really disappointed. I'm not keen on liars Mr Smith and I think that you've lied to such naive tourist like us: some brilliant actors were supposed to play the part and we only had different and pityful ones. Moreover the show was expected to begin at 19.30 but it was delayed of forty-five minutes. It is a shame! I ought not to talk about the restaurant  closed for no apparent reasons You had promised a perfect evening but I spend an horrible one  and you ruined my holiday! What are you mistaken us for, Mr Smith? Foolish idiots? We did not deserve such  bad show. That's why I want my money back! Now! Otherweise I'll have to put some others ads  in London saying that your show is just a fake!  [SEP]  How modern technology changed your daily life! To begin with, I'd like to underline how the place of technology has increased since a couple of years. With the end of the Second world war and the  economic prosperity many goods like TV, washing-machine, etc. became cheaper and available. Nowadays, the Internet and the mobile phone with the developpment of satellite  seem to take the lead. Do they affect my daily life? As far as I am concerned, the first way modern technology influence me is in my work: the internet has become such an incredible tool, I can make research about everything I want, find informations for lectures for example or exercices. The internet is really the widest source of knowledge. Nevertheless, new technology has made me become more lazy. I spend a lot of  free time watching TV, or surfing on the Internet or playing  the computer. Maybe it  change me into a kind of self-centered person, a loner. But the positive way new technology have changed my life is in  way  to communicate. It made it possible to discover, to talk with new people on the Internet but also to join and to be joined by my friends or parent. I can send e-mails or use the mobile phone. But we should not forget that it's only tools and  emphazise human relationships. ",23.0

I also want to congratulate you for your exellent competition, thank to which I have the opportunity to go to California, a place that I always wanted to go . About the travel, I think it would be preferable to do it on July, which is a holiday periode and so I won't have any special obligations. While in California I would prefer to sleep in a tent, so I can live closer to the nature. Anyway the accommodation is not a big problem for me, because I will be away most of the time. Stay a lot of time in the same place in my opinion is the worse thing to do, specialy during a trip! Moreover  would like  if it is possible to have an opportunity to play tennis and basketball. Any little tournaments of this kind would be greateful. Before ending my letter I would like to know and be told specialy in what kind of clothes should I have to take with me and also if you could change some money of mine in Dollars. I look forward to hearing from you Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Dear Kim, As you know last month I went to help at a concert, the one that I told you  in my last letter. I wanted to go very much there and so go there for helping was for me a unique chance. Moreover instead of bying a ticket I entered there for free, as a helper. From the first time that  went there I understood that I was going to have a great night. OK in the beginning the other helpers and I had a lot of work to do, so as cleaning the stage and so some decoration work. But as the correct started and we finished what we had to do, we were free to do what ever we wanted. So the party started... The pop concert was exellent and I had a lot of fun. Don't ask the time in which I come home because I don't remember! Some of my friends who were also helping told me that we returned at six o'clock in the morning!

I would appreciate  if I could travel on July because my school gives me two winter holiday's week. As far as accommodation is concern, I prefer staying in a long cabin. I believe it is better than a tent because this one would not shelter enough. As I said before, I have been playing tennis for four years. I consider myself to be good at this sport. As regarding painting, I know a lot  since my grandmother taugh me when I was five years old. It would be very kind of you to let me know about the clothes you think it would be necessary for me to take and how much money I will need. I look forward to hearing from you.

679," Hello, Firstly I would like to thank you for your prize. This travel enjoys me because I never go to  USA. Secondly I am going to answer your questions. I can travel only  July because I study in an ingenior's school in France and in Summer we have  holidays since July. I prefer to live in tents, where it is easier to make contacts with other people than in log cabins. When I travel I don't often sleep in  hotel, I prefer tents and also I can meet people, who lives in the country. For the activities I would be very happy if I could play golf. That is a sport that I always want to practise but in France it is to expansive. So if I have this opportunity, I don't want to fail it. I would like to photograph  too. There are so much monuments in California and so I will remember these holidays with my photographies. Could you send me more informations about  clothes to take with ? Finally I would like to ask you, if I need some money because you say all accomodation and travel costs are paid for. Thank you for your answer. Charles Dumaux  [SEP]  Hello Kim, Last month, I enjoyed helping at a pop concert. It was marvellous!!! I was in the backstage, so I could speak with the singer before the concert. During half an hour he explained  me, how he feel in France. I had to serve glasses of water to the group before and during the concert, so I had a lot of contact with them. They are very gentle. After the concert, I went to eat with them in a restaurant near the stadium, where they had played. What I particularly liked about this experience is that I saw that famous people are like us and have the same interest. I think that this experience is something that you have to live too. Perhaps in the next concert we will go together. I will give you news about it. I hope you will answer my letter and say me if you are interesting in my proposition. I send you with my letter a photo of the singer, what he give me. See you later. Charles ",26.0
547," Dear Mrs. Ryan, Thank you for your letter. I was very surprised that I have won the first prize in your competition. First I would like to mention that I can only travel in July, because I will work in August in a web designer studio. So I am unable to go on holiday to another time. I would prefer to stay in a tent because I like camping very much. I think it's more exciting to be in a tent than in a log cabin. I was very surprised that you offer such a great variety of sports and courses. I would like to do Basketball and Painting. I played Basketball at school for about two years. I am rather good in it. I also had Painting as  main subject at school for five years. I like painting very much, and I think I am good in Painting. I paint a lot in my free time. I prefer painting landscapes and fantasy-pictures. I would like to ask you, how much money will we need? Which clothes should we take with us? I hope to hear from you soon. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  First I would like to point out, that this was a good idea to present our school in a short film. I think first of all we should film an english lesson, where pupils could prepare some group work or information-boards. I think it is also important to present a comercial english lesson, maybe the pupils could write ""offers and orders"" or enquiries on the blackboard. Next I would film a BWPM lesson. This subject teachs the pupils how to make good presentations. They go together in groups, then they prepare power point presentations and at least they present it in front of the other pupils and teachers. It would be also very interesting to film the situation during the brake. The smokers in the school yard, the buffett and the other pupils, who are sitting in front of their tables writing their homework. I think then we should film an informatic-lesson. It would be funny to present the computers, which are often overcharged, or often the netserver is spinning. It's really funny to see the helpless teacher, who wants to go on writing in excel or a word text, while the computers do not work or brake down. I think that would be all for our video.

I am afraid that reality had nothing common with the things I suspected to meet. First of all, the prices weren't lower in any cases although you advertised the information like that. Then, I expected the show to start on time, but it turned out that I had to wait 45 minutes. Moreover, when the play started at last, I couldn't look at the actors. Especially I was disappointed by Danny Brook who made me nervous with his lack of talent. According to your advertisement, there was a possibility to have dinner in your restaurant, but I was surprised when I found it closed. After that, I should also mention, that this evening was dull, boring and the worst in my life. I am looking forward to hearing from you and I insist that you refund my lost money at once. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Come back to paradise There is no doubt that fashion affects people and makes them obsessed with this subject, but what can be designed more? Can you imagine the trend which will be as shocking as it has never been? The clothes is part of each culture and one of these things which expresses our taste and personality. People spend a lot of money to buy something extraordinary, feel comfortable and stand out. They come up with many ideas but it can't last for a long time. Nowadays it's getting obvious that designers sold only details, but significant changes don't turn up. Styles mix, colours and shapes come back from the past,  only the fabrics are different. People look for something new but it is not so easy to be creative all the time. Teenagers are bored with casual fashion and their parents laugh at them because of the fact they wear common clothes. That's why I believe in the solution which is the closest to human nature and can help us to omit the boredome I am sure that at last we will take off our clothes and in the future we will be undressed and free there won't be any problem with being up-do-date. As it was previously stated I am convinced that the reality will turn out to be a paradise where the most important  will be  body and  purity of our soul. ",32.0
960," Dear MRS HELEN RYAN. I am very pleased with the prize that I won and I would like to give you more information about it, because I would really really like to go to California, I have always wanted to go to California. First of all, I'm very ill at the moment and I need about a week to get better and I would like to travel within the next few weeks if  is possible (July 2000). In accodance with what you have told me about the accommodation I would prefer to go and stay in tents, because I think their unusual and  is not something that you do everyday. You have also asked me to give you two activities (sports) which I would like to do while I am at the camp. The kind of activities that I like from the list that you gave me are Basketball and Swimming. I would also like to ask you about the weather to see what kind of clothes shall I take with me. On the other hand I don't know how much money I should take. Is the food paid for? What about all the other expenses like gas, electricity, water and all the others. May I ask you to bring me some more information about the question that I have asked you ? Thank you very much about your letter Yours SINCERELY  [SEP]  Dear Mrs Andersen I would like to give you, and the others in the class my opinion (for the video that you are going to do) about which lessons and other activities should be filmed and why. Well, in my point of view the most interesting lessons that we do at school but  in real life are useful, are maths because everything we do is all about maths. The other lesson that I think is very important is physics because of the same reason as maths. On the other hand I think that geography is important as well because we must all know WHERE we live, what are the problems that we have in this world, what problem does every different country have and where does the petroleum come from and what are the advantages and disadvantages for  it and  the gold as well, there are loads of thinks about geography that we MUST KNOW. In accordance with all that I have written to you above I think that there is something else you must put in the video film. You can put  a few activities (sports) like basketball, football,  tennis, but only those because their are very popular and people will have interest on them. My advise for you is: ""Do not put  to much subjects, just put  a few subject and make them look interesting"" Yours SINCERELY ",24.0
1014," Dear Mr Robertson, On behalf of our class I would like to give you some information about the London Fashion and Leisure show, that we saw advertised and we are interested  indeed. In addition we would like to thank you about the programme. Firstly, I would like to give you some details about this show. It will take place in  Central Exhibition Hall, in London, on Tuesday  14th of March and the suitable time will be 10.00 - 19.00 I would like to mention that  this day we are going to visit the Science Museum in the morning and after we are going for shopping, so I believe it will be a good change for all of us to attend this show as it is free for students! The most important thing is that the time that the show starts is perfect and is suitable as well with our programme because until 19:00 I think that everyone will have finished their shopping. Secondly, I would like to give you more details about the show and particularly  what does it include. The latest fashion will be on show and also the Leisure and sports wear. Really interesting! Moreover all about the make up and the hairstyles. I think that it will be a great opportunity to all of us to be on this show while we are going to be in London. But, if there is a problem that the show is on Tuesday afternoon, the same hour with shopping, I suggest having the shopping on Wednesday afternoon that we will not have anything to do! I look forward to your reply, Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Some people think that to be a famous person is  very excuiting thing, that all the time this makes you feel completely and also they think that if you are famous you are special as well. I believe, that if somebody wants the fame and the glory  must be tottally sure about the results. For example, the politicians the have choosed their careers, they must know that they are going to involved with everything that it has to do with publicity and their country and the most important  is that they have to realize that they should be extremely careful of their movements or else they are going to have  bad reputation, and they will be not  trustworthy. Another succesfull carreer such as, film stars must also be balanced. If somebody is a film star this mean that  has got a different kind of life,  more comfortable, more interesting  but it doesn't mean that he or she can't be like normal people even if he or she is a star. If somebody wants to be famous of cource  must be on the top and the mass media will be following him or her. But I think that the are limits. Everybody deserve to have a private life even if he is a plumber or even if she is a famous singer. It doesn't matter what kind of carreer or job you are follow. You must control your behaviour and try not implove so much yourself. And finally the journalists the should know how to respect the private life of everyone and not trying to make money for a living by using the reputation of the famous people. ",23.00
481," Dear Sir, My name is ***. Recently I spent a week's holiday in London. read the advertisement and I found it interesting so I though that it would be nice to spent one of the nights I had in London at your musical show. But I was completely wrong. It was an awful experience. I had come with two friends on the 21st  August, and one of the reasons was that we were big fans of Danny Brook and we were looking forward to watch his show. You can imagine  disappointing  was to find out that he was replaced by another actor   not so popular. We were there at 19:15 as the show was starting at 19:30 for getting our tickets. We asked for the discounts you were refering at your advertisement but  the counter  told us that they were not available because it was Sunday. That was terrible but we didn't want to make a big deal of it so we went inside and waiting. The show started forty-five minutes later. We got really bored waiting. After the show had finished we went for dinner at the theatre restaurant but it was closed because the owner was ill. From all these reasons you can understand how unpleasant our evening. was We are asking you to return our money. Hope you'll understand Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. From the time she was a child she couldn't keep anything for herself, she always shared her thoughts with other people She was about sixteen years old when she moved to another city with her family. She went to a new school and she had no friends. She was not very sociable and she could not create relationships very easily. By the time she became close friend with Kim, who was really strange to  other students and everybody disliked her. Pat was wondering why and one day she found out. Kim explained  her that she kept the distance from the other students because her father was in prison and  didn't want no one to find out. Pat Kept this a secret for two months but one day told it by accident to a boy from her class. In a few days all  school was familiar with Kim's story. Kim was terrified because everyone was making fun on her and   very angry with Pat. Pat had to make  up . She had to find a way to make Kim forgive her. She had found the perfect way. She stand up infront of the whole classroom and explained that Kim's father actions didn't influence Kim. That she was a great friend to her and if someone owed to be punished that was her. Kim forgave her and all the students understand how wrong they were and were very sorry. They  all got to know the real Kim know. ",37.0
751," Dear Sir or Madam, Thank you very much for the prize. I am writing this letter to inform you that I have recieved your letters and I am going to the trip. I would like to go to the trip in July because my school, which is Berkeley International School, is going to arrange the end of term break both for staff and students. Other reason is I think in July the weather is not so cold. The weather condition will be suitable for camping. I prefer to live in tents to log cabin because sleeping in the tent makes me more comfortable and I can get closer to the nature. Every night I would like to come out of the small tent to the nice enviroment outside the tent. Although, living in the tent is more comfortable. I'll have to be aware about insects so I've bought so many insects repellant. I can choose to do 2 activities so I would like to play tennis and  swimming. When I was in  fourth form, I got the first prize in  swimming competition and third prize in tennis. I was a bit disapotted with the result because I was expected to win the first prize or secound price. Lastly, I would like to ask you  questions. First, how many clothes do I have to bring? And do I have to bring some money. It will be very kind of you, if you can answer my questions. Your sincerely, Seua Thanapol.  [SEP]  Dear Kim, Hi! How are you. I am fine and I hope you're fine too. I have an interesting story to tell you. I've been asked to help by the well known band called Westlife. At first I was surprised but in a few secound later, when I relised that, I didn't allow to go, I tried to persuade my teacher to let me go. At last, she allowed me . I had to help them behind the state, while they were get dressed. I had to keep things in place and cheakd that the microphones was working properly. Although the work was not heavey, I gained a lot of experience. They gave me their signature and when the concert started, they told me to come up on the state and dance with them. I was really embarassed because I had to dance in front of a lot of people but that is the very good experience I have ever had. I was really enjoy at the concert. Thing that I particularly like in the concert is I got a free ticket from Westlife to go to the A1 concert which is another well known band. I really want to have that experience again. That is my story. Tell me yoors. I want to know what experience you've had when you were in England. Best wishes, ",28.0
1191," Dear Maria First at all, I am sorry about Richard illness. Please remember me to him and give him my best wishes. About your request, I'm going to give you all the information that I think you must need, however you can call me if you consider it necessary, (my phone number is 2496 9731). Your group has been booked into the Palace Hotel. Because it is a wellkown hotel it should be easy to find it. Moreover, it is really well-located so it will allow you to move around the city without any problem. Even more the conference is going to take place in the Exhibition Centre, which is located only five minutes walking far from the Hotel. We haven't asked for any special clothes so I would wear casual and comfortable clothes, although you can come well-dressed, if you feel better . After the conference we are going to have an informal dinner with a previous snack time in order to introduce  each others. Finally in my opinion, you should visit the Art Gallery. It will take you two or three hours but it's a gorgeous place. I look forward  hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  ""Sagrada Familia"" a real holly building. If you are looking for a special building in Barcelona, which you can like whatever your tastes are, you should visit the ""Sagrada Familia"". Among the big number of choices, this unfinished church offers a gorgeous view fro the top of its towers, a charming story and one of the most representative examples of the Catalonia modernisme art. Gaudi conceived  this church n 1912, though it wasn't until 1920 they started to build it. Since the beginning the work was interrupted in different periods and started again. After Gaudi death it was critical stop which was fortunately solved three years later. Nowadays, a hard work is being done in order to finish  as soon as possible. The visitor can wonder around all the building or follow a guided visit. There is a exhibition room where maps and projects can be consulted. And, unless you suffer from your heart , you should climb the 350 steps which carry you to the top. There you can enjoy a terrific view, not only will you see almost all the city but also you will discover another perspective of this magnific building. ",34.00
321," Dear Mister, I am writing from Paris where I live. My wife an I spent a couple of days in London two weeks ago. We were really pleased because it was our first time in England. We asked our travel agent to organise our trip. My wife and I are both found of theatre, musical shows especially. It is so rare to see musical in Paris that we decided to book two seats for ""Over the rainbow"". We were very disappointed! Of course, the show didn't start on time. No reasons or excuses were given. Our travel agent told us that it would be cheaper to purchase our tickets directly in the theatre. But, in fact, there were no discounts available. And we had to pay £20 each seat. The worst was to come. The great Danny Brooks was supposed to be the main character. But, instead of him, we saw an unknown actor (who really need singing lessons). After the show we had planned to go to the theatre restaurant. But it was closed. Perhaps it was a  luck! So we want you to give us our money back, the show didn't worth the price. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  And now, I was wondering if I had not made a mistake. My brother was too talkative! Two days before, I told him that our father was about to buy a brand new car. And he did not want our mother to be informed. It was supposed to be a gift for twenty years of marriage. A car only for her. The first thing Pat did was to tell our young sister the secret. And, less than five minutes later, our mother knew the whole thing. Her reaction was not the one we were expecting. Apparently she was not surprised, but she was surely angry. Really angry!! She thought it was a stupid idea, and also an expensive one. According to her, this car would have been useless. She suspected our father to want to please himself. Then, we decided to offer her a red bicycle. It was the colour my father had chosen for the car! ",30.0

396," To whome it may concern, I am writing to tell  that I had a very disappointing evening regarding a musical show at your theatre. There are some things that I was not completely satisfied with and I would like to point them out. Firstly, the advertisement told that Danny Brook was going to starr in a musical but it turned out  a completely different person which was very disappointing. It was very unprofessional of you to had printed a wrong starring name on the paper. Secondly, according to the advertisment, the musical was supprsed to start at 19.30 but it actually started at 20.15 which caused me a trouble. As for my ticket, I was expecting to get a discount as a student, as it said so in the advertisement, however, it was not actually available which was very disappointing again. Then, I was hoping to have a meal at the theatre restaurant which was recommended in the advertisement, however, it was not possible for me to do so as the restaurant was closed due to the stuff vacation which I thought was very unprofessional. With all the dissatisfuction above, therefore, I would like to ask for some of my money back as my evening was not what it would have to be. I hope that you will consider this letter seriously and try to improve your service. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. How did we know that she was that kind of person? Well, it all begun when Pat's friend, Molly, went down to London... Molly went down to London for  shopping and as she was walking  the street. She found  familier faces on the other side of the street. It was Vance and Sally whom she had not seen for ages. Pat, too, are  friend of them and has seen them  time to time. Molly, Vance and Sally had a quick chat and said good-bye to each other as, to Molly, they seemed to be in a hurry and as Molly knew that they have been dating, she wanted them to enjoy their own time . After Molly went back home in Aberdeen, she told Pat that she had met Vance and Sally in London. Then suddenly, Pat's face turned to look confused and  said in a small voice, 'Haven't they broken up  long time ago? Sally must have a new boy friend'. As Molly didn't know this, she was so surprised and tried to ask more about it. Then, Pat realized that it was supposed to be kept as a secret but it just came out of her mouth! She didn't mean to do so, but this kind of thing happens a lot. Now Pat is feeling so guilty about what she has done because Molly isn't good at keeping secrets either! Everyone is going to know that Sally has been cheating both on Vance and her new boyfriend and the Poor Vance is always the last person to know it.  ",32.0
445," Dear Sir, I have come to watch the musical show called 'Over The Rainbow' in the Circle Theatre. I was really disappointed because a lot of things were not done. I will explain these now and want to ask to get some of the money I have given you back. It was written that Danny Brook and Tina Truelove were starring in the show. Danny Brook was not there, a different actor was in his place. That was very disappointing for me. The musical show was going to start at 19.30, but it started t 20:15. We have waited for 45 minutes getting bored for it to start! When I went to buy tickets, they didn't accept the discounts. But I had read that the discounts were available. Like it was written again, we went to visit the theatre restaurant after the show, but it was closed. They said that the time was late and they wanted to go home. There was nothing for us to do, the show started 45 minutes later. Now, I think that you have seen it was not a perfect evening at all, a lot of  things written were not done So I am asking to get some of my money back.

I go shopping, watch TV, walk around the city, use my computer and get lost in  Internet. etc. Modern technology is everywhere in my life. I don't see it in a normal day, but when I sit and think, its everywhere! For example, I get up whenever I want using my watch or clock. It's not a good example for modern technology, but it's a piece of technology at last! TV was black and white at first and there were only two or three channels. Now it's colourful and there are many channels on TV. You watch whichever you want. I can't think that I watch the same channels every day. A wonderful example for modern technology:  Computer! It is not a living thing but it has a brain. It knows more than most of the people. And  Internet. You can look for everything you want. You can talk to every people living all around the world. You don't understand the time passing when you are in that world. You can have information about all the things,  go everywhere. Everything is near you. You can reach them whenever you want!

I am agree that the most of the people enjoy buying cloths, food, something for the house presents . Because  is something it goes with their culture.

I would like to tell you something about what you asked me in the letter. Firstly, I can travel only in July because I have no time except  July as I am a postgraduate student. I would very much like to stay in a log cabin. I think it is a wonderful idea to stay in a tent only for  few days but not over 3 days. It will be more comfortable to stay in a log cabin. Regarding with two activities I will choose swimming and photography. I am not good at swimming but I would very much like to learn how to swim this year. On the other hand, I am very good at photography as I was a photographer in a club while I was in the college. Lastly I would particularly like to know about clothes and money. Isn't it cold at night in the Camp California? I like ice cram, sweets and beverage very much especially in the summer. Are these expensive? Could you please tell me about these? I am looking forward to your reply. Yours sincerely, Shin Parade  [SEP]  Do you think shopping is always enjoyable? Well, it might be true but I think it depends on the situation. When you do shopping, you can see various products  even very extraordinary thing. You can also see more graceful and fine thing. You usually visit many shops and compare the quality and the price and select the best one which suits to you. On the other hand, it usually take much time to get what you exactly want. Because you have to visit many shops and see many thing. If  shopping mall is not collected, it is physically hard to get what you want. It's not easy to shop with someone who are not interested in shopping. In conclusion, shopping is not always enjoyable as many people think. It depends on the situation. It even varys with  people whom you shop with. ",31.0

The first thing that dissapoint me was the starring. I expected to see Danny Brook because at the paper that you have given to me it wrote that Danny Brook came but there was a different actor. Then you wrote that it start at 19.30 but it started at 20:15. You wrote that discounts  available but they are not available. You wrote that ""visit our restaurant after the show"" so I didn't eat my supper, to eat at your restaurant. but the reastaurant was closed because the show started  20:15 and finissed at 00.15 and the restaurant was opened until 00.00. Finally you wrote that  ""your perfect evening out"" but after all this problems how would you expect the to have a perfect evening out. After all this problems I became dissappointed. Because that was only a week holiday in London. If you would give me some of my money back that would be a great excuse for the loss of time and my dissopointness.  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't good at keeping secrets. I know that before but I thought that he may change. I trusted him and told  about the reality. It was about Marine, who was our clase friends. The reality was  Marine's parents are not her real parents, they found her in their houses garden. They try so many things to find her family for one year they did everything to find her family but they couldn't find . In this one year they spend most of their time with Marine and they loved her so much and they want to be her parents. When Marine was three years old a man came to their house and sad that he is Marine's father and  wont to take her. and he added that he leave Marine because her mother was dead two days after Marine's birth. and the police thought Marine's father did this so they put him on prison he had nobody that he can give marry  so he leave her on their garden.

39," 16th, Dec. 2000 Dear Mr. Clark, I'm writing this letter to complain and to suggest something about your ""International Arts Festival"". I visited the festival for 2 days. I also read an advertisement in ""The Times"". I thought it would be interesting and exciting. When I visited the festival, of course, it was really good. I was impressed of the idea of the festival. I could enjoy different culture and also I could expand my knowledge. Moreover, the weekend ticket was fantastic because I spent two days  the festival - Saturday and Sunday. The ticket price was not too expensive for  student too. However, you said ""Stars and artists from around the world"" in the advertisement. But there were only six countries' candidates. It was exaggerated. Besides, some concert halls were too small. Jazz and classical concerts' halls were especially small. It caused a long queue and I had to waste my time. Except  these two things, it was quite good. I'd like to suggest this - concerned with plays and films. Plays and films qualities were good, but quantities were bad. In addition, most of the people in the festival liked that. In my opinion, you have to run more plays and films in next year's festival. I'm looking forward to hearing your answer. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  I'd like to tell you about my experiences. Before that you have to think  why you need to earn money and how you do that. It is really important because making money needs a proper purpose. Firstly, I did newspaper delivery. I could make a bit of money, of course, it was far much than pocket money. Nevertheless, I lost my concerntration to the study and I spent the money to entertainment. I earned easily and I couldn't control myself at that time. I was only 12 years old. Secondly, I made  brochure for a company when I was in high school. I was studying computer at that time. Also I was leader of the computer user circle in the school so I needed some money for managing the circle. For this reason, I took this kind of part-time job in the company. Despite the fact that it was  part-time job, I worked very hard because I liked computer works. I could earn money,  also I got a career. Finally, I worked for a factory during the last winter holiday. It was also hard and difficult, but I think that was  easy way to make money. I forgot many skills and knowledge during the time. So  lose was bigger than  profit. In conclusion, if you want to earn a bit of money, then you have to choose  proper part-time job. Because you will get some money as well as some career and knowledge. You must consider the purpose too. If you haven't  purpose, you would waste money easily and quickly. ",27.00

I decided to go to see this show because of its starrings, but at the day I saw it, a different actor played. He was not DANNY BROOK. Moreover there was no discount ticket. They were all sold out. You should have said they were very few. I had to buy a £20 ticket. To make matters worse, the time that the show started was delayed. It started at 20:15, fourty five minutes later! That's why I couldn't have a dinner at the theatre restaurant after the show. It had already closed, when the show finished. I'd like to ask for a full refund for this awful night. Could you give me a satisfactory reply as soon as possible. yours faithfully  [SEP]  Modern technology has changed my life. Especially, a computer has made my daily life change dramatically.  It is only two or three years since I  have used a computer at home, but now I wonder how I can live without it. I open my e-mail box every night. When I find a new message, I'm very happy. Before using e-mail, I used to write letters and sometime  telephon. However I've found e-mail is better than them. Because as soon as I send my message, they can receive it. In the other word, I can also receive their reply soon. It's really useful, when I need  quick reply. Overmore when I send e-mail, I need not worry about the time. I can send them anytime I like. Thanks to modern technology, I enjoy chatting with my friend in other countries and my family in Japan almost every day. ",31.0
145," 17-6-00. Mr. Smith, I write to you because last night, (Saturday 10), I went to see the musical show that you are presenting at the Circle theatre. I am a great fan of Danny Brook and went to see him in his new show, but, to my surprise, it wasn't him who played that night but another horrible young actor. I went with my daughter, a university student, and she was supposed to have a discount on the ticket. We asked for it and we were told that there was not discount neither for her not for anyone else, so I had to pay the full price of the two tickets. Furthermore, it was announced to start at 19.30 p.m. and it started at 20.15 p.m. for reasons anyone would explain to the audience. After the play, we went to the theatre's restaurant and we found out that it was closed since 1999's spring! How can you ask the people to go to a closed restaurant? In conclusion, I would be very grateful if you could send me my money back because, as you have seen, I didn't spend the ""perfect evening"" you announce. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Although he had promised Lise that he wouldn't say a word, when he reached the school he told the secret to Ann. Of course, Ann promised not to tell anyone, but by the lunch-break all the school knew that Lise had stolen the literature exams. Very soon, Lise understood that it was useless to continue pretending that she knew nothing about it, and decided to make a deal with her class mates. She would give them the exam's questions and they would make all her homeworks during 3 weeks. There was no escape. It was an unfair deal, but if they wanted the questions they had to accept, and if they accepted, they couldn't tell anything to the teachers, because, in fact, they were as guilty as Lise. Unfortunately, the perfect plan doesn't exist, and a teacher heard two students talking in the bathroom. The teachers started investigating and asking all the students, but it was a secret and they couldn't say a word. Finally, the teachers asked Lise and her friends. No-one said a word. Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. ",34.0
741," Dear Miss Ryan. I am writing to inform  the further information about myself. I was very glad to hear that I won the competition. First of all, I can only travel in July. I have a summer holiday from at the end of June to at the begging of September as I am a student, but I am planing to work in August as a part-time job. So that's the reason why I can not travel in August. I prefer to stay in tents rather than log cabins, because I have had a camping once and I stayed in tents. It was great to have a fun and also it was very good memorise. As you said I will have the opportunity to do two activities. I am quite good at singing and I have a talent about singing that  I can entertain people by singing. In addition I am keen on swimming but actually I am not very good at swimming because I have just started to learn swimming but I have really been enjoying it and I think it will be  good chance to improve my swimming. In fact, I have some questions that how much money I will need, what else I have to bring with  and if I have a emergency what you can do for. Once again, I am very happy to have such a good opportunity and I hope this letter can bring what you want to know about me. Thank you for your attention. Yours sincerely Lee. Han  [SEP]  These days, there are so many people  like shopping that it is one of the important part in our life. It is not, however, always enjoyable that there are both advantages and disadvantages. First of all, there are quite many advantages of shopping  are that it can be the solvation of our stress and boring. When you are under stress or when you are bored, if you go to shopping, then at least it can be  motive to change your mode. Also shopping makes people happier by using a lot of money and it influnce even  economic situation more flexably. There are, in contrast, disadvantages at the same time. When we are having a shopping, we often find that the place where people often go for a shopping is too crowed and it makes us more tired. Also there are plenty of dangerous that lots of people have  wallet stollen because it is a public place and there are too many people. In addition shop owner often cheat their customers by increasing the cost secreatly. The customer can never know what price is the normal  unless they have a same shop or  same thing. To sum up, shopping is  very important part of our life and we can have a lot of fun, however it is not always enjoyable which means we can not find only advantages from it. ",22.0
546," 13.06.2000 Dear Mrs Ryan Thank you very much for your letter. You would like to have some further information from me. I am writing to answer your letter. I would like to travel only in July because I have been working in a bank and I can only go on a holiday in July. I would prefer to stay in a tent because I used to go camping and stay in the tent. Therefore I would like to try some kind of experience. I am interested in tennis but I am not so good  tennis player. However I would like to attend tennis activity. In addition swimming would be  good activity for me. While I was studying at the high school and the university, I was in the swimming team of the school. I would like to ask you about clothes and the money. Could you tell me what kind of clothes I should bring? When I go there, can I use  credit card or should I have cash? I look forward to your answer. Yours sincerely,   [SEP]  I think all people like shopping. When you ask some people to learn their opinions about shopping they can tell you they don't like shopping but I suppose it is not true. For example me, when someone asked me about shopping I would say that I hadn't liked it. However now if someone asks me the same question my answer will be ""yes, I like it"". When people hear this word shopping they only think about to go  some stores and try  new clothes or shoes and search for their size and so on. They don't think about other kind of shopping which are liked by themselves. Maybe they like shopping on  internet or window shopping  doesn't matter what kind of shopping they like. There are a lot of shopping style on the world I am sure everybody prefer one of them. In my opinion, even though people say shopping is not always enjoyable, there are always some fun you can find. You only need to discover what you like, and how you can have fun with shopping. ",25.0
252," BRASILIA (DF), JUNE 17th 2000 Dear Manager, I'm writing this letter to express my disappointment with ""Over the rainbow"", the musical show which I watched last evening. First of all, according to the advertisement, one of the main actors would be DANNY BROOK who I love. Instead of this, I had to watch the performance of a different and unknown actor who wasn't so great as I expected. Secondly, the show started one hour late and I hate waiting in a queue more than it's necessary. I felt very upset and my enjoyable night became a stressed and very expensive one, too. There wasn't  discount avaiable for the tickets and I went to the theatre with my three cousins from Brazil. In addition to this, after the show, we looked for the theatre restaurant which has been closed for repairing since one month ago. In conclusion, last night definitely was the worst experience about entertainment I've ever had in my life and that's why I ask you  my money back as a compensation. I'm looking forward to your reply faithfuly,  [SEP]  Modern technology can affect our daily life transforming our relationship   and the ways  to comunicate to other people as well as our life expectancy. With the introduction of the computer in our civilization we can access  Internet to comunicate with our relatives and friends living abroad or far from ourselves. Despite of the distances, we can keep our friendship closely and with a cheaply way. Besides of this, the information goes faster than it used to know and it's avaiable in the same time to every part of the world. On the one hand, our time is taken   to learn how to deal with the new technologies. On the other hand, we can feel more comfortable with them providing us  support to our hard tasks and letting us free to apply our attention and efforts to more important things. For instance, we can research new manners of improving our quality of life. In conclusion, we are able to feel or to recognize the benefits of the modern technologies but we should be aware about how they are introduced in our lives to avoid the dangerous side of the TECHNOLOGY.

136," Dear Sir/Madam, I was to  Circle Theatre to watch  'Over the rainbow' musical show, recently. I was trully dissapointed by it. My expectations were high after I've read your leaflet in which it was advertised as 'London's newest and best musical show'. Now, I can assure you it wasn't. Firstly, it was Danny Brook who was supposed to star. The substitute was far worse. Secondly, I had to wait fourty-five minutes before the show finally began. Another unkept promise are the discounts. There weren't any! Lastly, when I got hungry after the delay it appeared that the theatre restaurant is closed. You can believe me it wasn't 'my perfect evening out' and I have no other choice than asking  to give  my money back. I paid for something I didn't get so it is obvious that I want my money back. I got the £15 ticket. I'd like you to send the money to this adress; ul Taklowa 10 Skoclow 43-430 POLAND Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. After two days the whole school knew. When Paul entered the school gate, other children began to tease him and laugh. Paul couldn't stand it. He ran out quickly, leaving everyone behind. He felt very ashamed and didn't know what to do. Normally, he would go and talk to Pat but Pat betrayed him. They were no longer friends. 'How could he,' Paul thought 'Now the whole school knows Jean attracts me'. As he was sitting there, he heard someone walking towards him. He turned around and saw... Jean. 'What are you dong here, why aren't you at school?' she asked. Paul was like paralyzed. He couldn't reply. 'I had heard what you've said about me', she said, I think it's sweet'. Paul couldn't believe his ears. While he was thinking how to reply, Jean took his hand and led him to the school. When they entered everyone became silent. All the children were staring at them and Paul thought that Pat isn't that bad at all. ",30.0

282," Dear Sir, Last Saturday evening me and my family went to see the musical show ""Over the rainbow"" at your theatre. I'm writing this letter to express the reasons of our disappointment about that evening. The advertisement for the show said that there was discounts available for children so we brought them and when we bought the tickets we had to pay the maximum price for everyone. Then, when we got in, we had to wait because the show started forty-five minutes late. By then our children were very bored. My husband was looking for to seeing his favourite actor, Danny Brook, and when the show started he found out that Brook had been changed by a different actor. My husband was really unhappy. When the show had finished we decided to go for a snack to the theatre restaurant and it was closed without  giving any reason for it. As you can see, it wasn't the evening we expected and the result was very different from the promises you made in the advertisement. I think it would be reasonable if we could have our money back. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets and this was the reason why the party wasn't as succesful as we thought. My and my friends, including Pat, were preparing a surprise for Sam's birthday. We decided to go to his place (I've got a copy of the key) the evening before his birthday while he was at work and decorate the lounch, then turn off the lights and wait for him in silence until he arrived. Everybody was excited about the idea and we were keeping it in secret in front of Sam. Two days before the event Carol, Albert, Sam and me went to visit Pat in her house and she invited us to stay for dinner. We were having a wonderful time chatting and laughing but suddenly the phone rang and Pat answer it. It was her aunt inviting her  for the weekend so Pat said very loudly: ""I'm sorry but I have to go to Sam's flat and decorate it, it's a surprise, don't tell anybody"" Sam look at us surprised and said ""What's going on?"" Everybody had to change  plans and the party became a normal party. We were a bit disappointed but we enjoyed  anyway. ",36.0
895," Thomas West 24 Kingsberry place CS4 1XD Tuesday 13th june to Helen Ryan Competition Organiser at Camp California Dear Madame, thank you for your letter, I've been so happy to receave such a good news that I can't already believe it. To answer your first question, I would like to travel on july if it's possible, because I'll be on holiday and because a friend would be able to come with me at this time of the year. In the accomodation at Camp California, I prefer to rent a tent, he is going to be more funny, I think, but are the tents singles? I would be pleased if you could give me details about this question. I can see in the list a lot of interesting sports! But I think (it's difficult to choose) I'll choose golf and basketball, golf because I'm quiet good. I finished 5th at the England Golf tour junior  in 1999, and basketball, because I would like to discover this sport I only used to play at school. I've got other questions: wich type of clothes do I have to bring? Can I change money on the campus? Are some party organized during the holidays? Is there only one teatcher for each sport, and how many are we in each group of activities? Thank you for all  informations you could give me. I look forward to hear from you. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Report about which lessons and activities we should film. First, I think we can't shoot a film only about lessons or only about breaks, because this two elements are representative of a daily life at school aren't they? First, we should film some lessons because everybody know (or remember for the growns up) that it is the activity that to be the most of a student time at school. Just after, to make a contrast, we may film the break, because it's the other part of a daily school! It's the place where you can meet your friends, where you can talk free,  there are no teatchers, it could be a good contrast to the serious of the lessons. To come back to a strict (a little beat less) subject, I suggest that we film the sport lesson , doing that will allowed the spectator to see how does the students behave when they are all together and in small groups. Finally we should film the lunch, which is also a moment to relax for the students, and for the teatchers, we mustn't forget to film the teatcher room because if a school is made of students, it's also made of teatchers.

1206," Dear Mrs Smith, I am writing to you to give you more informations about an international student conference. The group has been booked into  King Hotel at High Street which is very easy to find. And the best way to get from there to the conference is  following the rod in front of the hotel to the right, then cross the zebra crossing to the opposite side. After that walk to the right about 15 metres and you will find the conference place which is called  White House. At the end of  conference, we are going to have an International Dinner as well as some shows from the students in my college. As this is a special conference so you could wear your own national dress to present your country. Finally, on the last day you could spend your free time to visit our town hall which you will be able to learn more about my area - or  do some shopping at High Street. If you want more information, please contact me and I am looking forward to seeing you soon. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Mr. Bill, I am writing to give an information on a very interesting building to visit. It is called Penrhyh Castle, as the building will tell you all about Wales. On the positive side, you and the group will be abe to learn more about Welsh art works which are presented on the wall, on the door and some furnitures. The building itself looks splendid and beautiful. On the other hand, you might find something which is very boring such as walking along the old wooden floor which causes some noise. And some old toilets might look awlful. But in my recommendation, I think it would be nice for the students to come and see this building. Because they will be able to learn and compare with the place in their country. As Wales is not modern like America, so the students will probably get the idea of looking back to the old things. Yours sincerely, ",28.00
1058," To: The Principal of Westminster College, Mr Robertson. From: Eirini X FCE Student Dear Sir, I am writing to you with a request for a change in the scedule of our trip to London. But, first of all, I would like to thank you for the time and the effort you have made to organize the entire programme. Everything seams very interesting and I am sure that we will all have a very good time. Unfortunatly I have to suggest a change for the programme of Tuesday the 14th of March. That's because the ""Fashion and Leisure Show"" takes place that date in London. All of the students - including my self, think of this as a great opportunity that  would be  pitty to be missed, especially when students can enter for free. According to the day's programme, we are visiting the Science Museum in the morning and we are going shopping in the afternoon. My suggestion is to use Wednesday's afternoon free time as an alternative solution of the shopping. This way we will be able to visit the Central Exhibition Hall on Tuesday evening, and see the show. I hope that you will find this possible. With best regards  [SEP]  It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. I had to try my limits for once again. This is my nature. I had to see how far I could go this time or, to be more specific, how high! I've always wanted to taste the freedom that birds have, always been interested in listening to my blood pumpping in my vains, full of adrenaline, tolet myself free to shake, from excitement. There were my thoughts when I first saw the advertisement for a ""Sky Dive"". I didn't hesitate much. The same afternoon I picked up the phone and I gave them a call. That was it. The following Sunday I fint my self on a plain flying 20000ft from the ground. When the time for the jump came I had some second thoughts. But then, I thought of the birds again - of how nice it would be to share their world for a few minutes and, I jumped! Well, danger is in my nature an Life is nothing but an adventure. ",37.00
1006," Dear Mary, I'm really happy to hear from you! I've had so much work at school recently (exams!) and so many things to do, that I've almost forgotten how good it is to relax and rest a bit. Fortunately, the people from my class are really great and we all love trips - especially interesting ones. The boat trip you're asking about in your letter was really fantastic and well organized, there were absolutely no problems and we had lots of fun! Here are some facts for you: The departures are at 8 am and 10 a.m. every day, but it's much better to set off earlier as the boat is less crowded then (I know you hate getting up early, but...). After two hours of the cruise, there is a stop at the beautiful Bourne Castle where they offer guided tours. I think such a tour is essential, because you can learn lots of interesting things about the history of the castle. After visiting the castle there is lunch at a restaurant, but you'd better take  picnic - it's so beautiful there! In the afternoon you can choose from a variety of water sports at the lake. Try windsurfing, you'll have lots of fun! I'm telling you - the trip was wonderful and I'm sure your group will like it. Especially that the prices are reasonable and if you have a group of 15 people, you get a discount. Try it and have fun! I'm looking forward to hearing from you, take care,  [SEP]  It was three o'clock in the morning when the phone rang. I rushed to answer it, but when I picked up the phone, there was nobody there. ""Stupid teenagers again"" - I thought angrily, climbing the stairs to my bedroom. Suddenly, I heard some strange sound behind me. I turned around quickly, but there was nothing - the sound disappeared. I began feeling a bit scared, not that I was afraid of ghosts, but...I had this impression that something was wrong. I stopped and listened. Nothing. A complete silence. After a minute I started walking up the stairs again and I heard the same sound - it was the sound of footsteps! I was so frightened that I could barely move, but I turned my head again. There was nobody . But something changed - the kitchen door was wide open. Suddenly I saw a figure of a man, dressed in black, moving towards me. I couldn't believe my own eyes, so I closed them quickly and ran to my sister's room. ""Jane"" - I shouted - ""There is a ghost downstairs! A man, dressed in a black suit!"" ""I know"" - replied my little sister peacefully, - ""It's Grandpa. Don't you know it's his birthday today?"" ""Yes, but our grandpa is dead, don't you remember?"" - I cried. ""That's right. But haven't you just said you've see a GHOST?"" - she asked and looked at me as if I had lost my mind. ",40.00
613," Dear Mrs. Ryan Thank you for your informing letter and your congratulations. I was very delighted to hear about my success in your competition and me winning the prize. I'm very looking forward to it as I've never been in the U.S.A. before. Unfortunately, the only month I can travel is July because I'm doing my final exams at university in June and then starting a job in August. Any two weeks during July will suit me perfectly. The best term would be from 17th July till 30th July. As for accommodation at Camp California, I prefer  tent. I'm used to sleep in  tent from my previous holidays and I always injoyed it. I'd just like to know if the tents at the camp are based on sharing and how many people is there in one tent. I really appreciate the choice of activities at the camp. It was hard to choose only two. I've chosen tennis and sailing. I've played tennis since I was eight years old and I'm very good at it. I'm also good at swimming and surfing but I'd like to try sailing. I was always attracted to it but never had an opportunity . Is it possible to start to learn it at Camp California? I'd also like to know how far is it to the nearest village and how much cash do I need for  two-weeks stay at the camp? Do I need to bring with me some special gear or equipment?

The job came unexpectedly as my friend, who was supposed to work there, broke her leg just two days before the event. So she asked me to fill her position. Even  I had planned something else to do I agreed because she's my very good friend. The concert was due to start at 7 o'clock but we had to be there two hours before the beginning. First I was supposed to help at the refreshment spot for the fans but some 15 minutes before beginning I was told to go to the backstage and help with the refreshment for the musicians, technicians and others who worked there. It was very hectic there as everyone was a bit nervous but I saw the main stars and even managed to talk to them. When they started to play I was told to change my post again. This time I was helping the medical workers who had full hands with fainted teenage girls. First, it seemed to me odd because I didn't understand why they faint, but as the concert went on, the heat in the air was increasing and so was the number of the fainted. It wasn't funny anymore and I didn't know what to do first. I was really shocked by the view of crying and shaking but absolutely happy girls sitting or lying on the floor. However, I manage to listen  the music and I must admit that I liked it. I actually injoyed it working there and I wouldn't hesitate to work there again. As I know you like this ",37.0

First of all, I would like to travel in July, because I can arrange 2 weeks in July with my school holidays, in order not to lose classes. I think I would prefer to be in  tents, because I think it is funnier and you can be in more contact with nature, but if I don't like the tents can I change my mind? You told me to choose 2 activities and I chose surfing and singing. In both of them I am very good. I did a surf course last summer and I have gone to singing lessons almost all my life. I have a few questions. How much money should I take to spend in those two weeks? and also what kind of clothes I should take? Please, when you recive this letter give me a call so we can arrange everything. Looking forward to hearing from you Yours sincerely  [SEP]  We are going to do a video about daily life at school, the following classes are the ones I recomend to film. ENGLISH: the classroom is beautifull, and in the same day we do a lot of diferents activities, so it won't be boring watching it because we can have a great time there. CHEMISTRY: We do a lot of experiments and the materials we use are very good. I think that if we film that class the people that watches it will be impress with the equipment we have got. SPANISH: We are doing a play now. We could film it and produce it, instead of uniform we could wear costumes, the ones that are animals could pain their faces. I think that if we do it properly we could have a great spanish play. Those three classes are my choises, I hope we could do them and make a very good video about our school. ",24.0
169," Mr Manager, I'm sorry of writing  you for such a bad thing, but my evening at your theatre wasn't as perfect as you announced: it wasn't perfect at all! I was pleased  to see Danny Brooke, he's my favourite actor, so you can easily imagine how disappointed I was when I saw a different and unknown actor on the scene! By the way, what really upset me was the time of starting. According to your advertisement it was at 19:30, and, what a surprise when I had to wait almost an hour until the show started at 20:15! Now let's talk about the tickets. You had promised discounts on the cost which was from £10 to £20, but despite my thoughts I had to pay £20 without   chance. In the end, I thought I could enjoy myself visit the theatre restaurant but it was closed because of something they didn't explain to me. As you can see it's not a perfect evening, isn't it?

This old man with his old boat goes too far away from the coast to try to fish  something good. By surprise he comes across the biggest fish he has ever seen, a beautiful marlin. The man keeps immediatly in contact with it. They are going to be one thing linked together. They're fighting for the same reason with the same strenght, the man has to kill a brother, as he calls the fish. I think they're really brothers, they feel the same pain and fear during the battle. If the marlin could speak it would have told the old man's  same thing. When the old man won the fight he felt sorry but pleased. He respected and still loves it. But, afterwards, the life's rule is MORS TUA VITA MEA and that's the most difficulty  to face  to. ",24.0
433," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to you because I went to The Circle Theatre some days ago and I regret to inform you that it was not a good experience. According to the advertisement Danny Brook was the male actor. However he did not act, and his sustitute was not very good at acting. Secondly I had problems with both tickets and time. The play started at 20:15 instead of 19.30. Furthermore I could not get a discount although I think I was entitled to it. (I have a special youth card). In addition the theatre restaurant was not available because of the waiters' strike. In conclusion, not only my evening was horrible but also expensive. That is why I ask you for refunding my money, or at least part of it. Faithfully,  [SEP]  Best Detective Stories of Agatha Christie (Accident) Dear Nigel, I was pleased to hear from you last week. Now I am writing to you because a story of Agatha Christie is going to be read on the radio. Its title is ""Accident"" I know you are interested in the author and I think you'll like the story. Firstly the main character is Evans, a retired police captain. He is not as well-known as Poirot or Miss Marple, but his personality it quite interesting. I am sure you'll agree with me. Secondly the plot. It is about a woman who poisoned her first husband. At least this is Evans' opinion. Not only is the plot interesting but also it catchs your attention since the first moment. Finally, you should pay attention to the ending which is surprising. I hope you will spend a good evening listening to the radio. The story is going to be read next Friday at 8.00 p.m. Have a good time and write soon. Love, ",35.0
522," Dear The Manager of the Circle Theatre, While I was staying in London for a holiday, I went to the Circle Theatre to see OVER THE RAINBOW in the evening. That made me feel disappointed. First of all, the actor was different from  your advertisement. I meant he was not Danny Brook. Secondly, it took times to wait about forty five minutes, because it started at 20:15. It should be on time at 19:30. Then it had no discounts, which the advertisement said so. Due to being a student, I think I should have got the discount from your ticket  with  ID card. Besides this, the theatre restaurant was early closed. As soon as the show ended, I went to there for having a dessert. Lastly, I don't think that it was my perfect evening. I would like to get my money back. I look forward to replying from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Griffin, who is a teacher, wasn't surprised at our preparation. It was so close to be on his birthday, so we made a decision to hold a small party for him. She has just learnt with us for three weeks. She is not talkative,  kind, and reserved. However,  this party she took part in, she was responsible for preparing food. As far as we knew, she's good at cooking. While she was choosing vegetables in a market, she came across him. When he asked her 'why do you choose deliberately?', she answered without thinking. That caused the secret  disclosed. We didn't blame her, because we knew that she didn't intend to do like that. Although he wasn't surprised, he was glad and pleased with our party. Anyway, Happy Birthday to Griffin, again. ",23.0
359," 17 June 2000 Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to complain about a musical show on  10 of June, and I was very disappinted. I was promised that the starring was Danny Brock but when I was there I saw just other starring that was completely difference from  your brochar. To make the matter worse, I was travelling to London to see this famous starring but I didn't see any shows of them. It make me a bit angry. According in your brochour, it was started to show at 19.30 p.m. but it was started at 20.15 p.m. I wanted to sleep and  very anoying. More than that, when I bought the ticket I didn't get any discounts. I had to pay full prise. I was promised that after  show I could go to  theatre restaurant but due to  started late we aslo finished late therefore, when I went to the restaurant they were deffinately closed. I was very hungry and tired. You said that it was a perfect evening out but it wasn't like that. I would like  to refund some  money back. I paid for the show £ 50.00 I also have a recite to prove it. I would like you to give my money back as soon as possible. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully, Phukana Najee  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. I have a really good, freind, Pat who I was trusted and counted on her. I have know her for five years. and we were love each other very much. One day, I was falling in love with  closest freind. I went out with him sometimes and we were happy. My boy freind was very handsome, clever and very polite. We were stedy at the same class at school and he also knowed Pat as well. Personally, I wanted to keep  serets because I  afraid that we might have splited up. And I would like to make sure that he was relly love me. My boy freind told me that he wanted to surprise his freind in his class when the times comes. To be honest, I wanted to share this felling to someone else but I needed to keep  very secret. I felt unhappy sometimes. One day I decided to tell my best freind - Pat who I realio-on her. I told her everything abat my boyfreind and when we were met each other and evertauly we were falling in love. After I told her I felt my feeling had been released and I was happy. I also told her to keep  very secret didn't tell anyone in the class. On Monday morning, I walked into the class and all of my freind was shouting at me and called my name and  my boyfreind. I was absolutely ambaressed and I wanted to ran out of the class. I felt very angry to Pat and I shouldn't have told her about my boy friend. I felt regret but  too late it wasn't  secret any more now. ",23.0
343," I would like to know some informations about the advertisement of the show. First of all, why  the show began at 20:15, not at 19:30 as indicated in the advertisement. I waited quite one hour to see the show, and what happened with the actor? I came to that show only for see him and when the actor appear, it was another one. There is more! Where were the discounts that I should have earned? I was very disappointed with that! After the show my sun wanted to eat some biscuits and when I see the restaurant closed, I gave up, I told to my sun that we'll never come back here again. The restaurant was closed because there wasn't  electricity you should close the theatre untill the restaurant get appropriate to use. I was totaly unsatisfied with the theatre and I would like to have my money back if it's possible. I thank you for read my letter, I hope you write for me back, and don't forget my money!  [SEP]  I am writing what I think what kind of clothes will people wear 100 years from now . As we see the clothes are changing every hour. People  inventing new kinds of clothes and people  buying and wearing differents clothes. It is difficult to say how people will be wearing clothes 100 years from now. In each country, each people wear differents kinds of clothes, like, people in Brazil wear shorts, T-shirts or only without them, in Saudi Arabian they wear strange clothes, if you analyse   the point of view  who doesn't live in Saudi Arabia. I'm quite sure that people in all   world will be wearing very differents clothes in the future because , especialy women,  like to be very elegant and beautiful will create and invent all kinds of clothes to anybody and that's it.

88," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to complain about your musical show. We had a very disappointing evening yesterday. We thought that we would like to let you know all  details  which it didn't make us happy. First of all, we went to the theather to pick up our tickets. We were thinking  to get some discount on our tickets, because we had already read  from the advertisement but they didn't discount the prices so we had to pay  complete money for the show. We were ready for the show at 19.30. We sat  out sits and waited for the show but it didn't come out on time, it started at 20.15 which was  redicoulus time. We waited for 45 minutes. Secondly, when the show started, I was looking for Danny Brook, because this actor was the most important reason for me to come here. I realised that it was  different actor playing instead of Danny brook. I was very disappointed. After  show we went immediately to the tickets office for asking   money back, but they were to strict and close-minded. They just said, ""we don't give money back."" However we wanted to eat something at the Theatre Restaurant, but it was again  same with the others, because the restaurant was closed. Finally, we had a totally unhappy night with your show. You can't take this bad feeling back but you might give us our money back. This would be the first good memory for us  from your show. We look forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully, Mr. and Mrs. Smythe  [SEP]  People, who lives in the city, use lots of technological stuff. They make their life style much easy  more fast because they need to catch up with the other people. In the twenty first century things are changing very fast. If we look at a family life. They have typical this time life style. Children have  own televisions, computers and telephones in their room. Mother and Father have  own cars and mobile phones. Sometimes even the children have  own mobile phone as well. Full of technological tools and instruments in the house. Fire alarm, burglar alarm, house temperature checker, automatic garage door many of them. They use all of this because they want to do their work, and leisure activities with this helping kits. In the other hand, thy use all this too much. For example a mobile phone; People talk with it on the street, in the car almost everywhere. Some of them necessiraly some of them not. Just wersting time on it. They don't even think how they take the communication lines are busy, how many people  on the phone at  same time. Too many Anyway technology is the most important thing for our life. It developes day by day. The problem is ""Do we really use it properly or not?"" ",26.0
1173," Dear Mrs Maria Smith, I am sorry to hear that Richard Brown isn't well and hope he'll get better soon. I am more than happy to give you the nessessary information. Your group has been booked into  Palace Hotel which is only 2 miles away from our college. The college will arrange  a mini-bus to come and pick you up every morning at 8:45, so you can arrive to the college around 9 o'clock and have some time before the conference starts at 9:15. The reason we don't suggest you to take a walk from your hotel is that you'd have to walk through a large building site which is not going to be suitable for a group of 20 students. As you already know we are going to have the end-of-conference party where the Head of the college will give a small speech at the begining, then it will  a buffet and a disco. You don't need to dress up smartly but please, make sure that your students don't wear short or trainers. Regarding to what you could do in your free afternoon on the day you leave I would suggest you to take the students to our History Museim. It's not very big but it has got some amazing information about the history of our town and their people. There is also a gift shop in there, where your boys and girls can buy some soveniers for their families and friends. I hope I've answered all your questions but if you need anymore information, please let me know. I am looking forward to seeing you all soon. Best regards,  [SEP]  To my personal opinion one of the most important and useful thing which has been invented in a car. Cars take a big part in our life. Everywhere you look you can see cars. More and more people learn how to drive and choose to travel by car, because it saves a lot of time comper to travelling by public transport. Cars are also more reliable than other types of transport. You don't have to wait on a bus stop on a cold and windy weather for a late bus, or being stuck on a train for an hour due to some railtrack repairs, you can just jump into a car, tune your radio onto your favourite station and have a plesant drive to your distanation. Cars are even more important for emergency situations such as  fire in a house or if somebody is critically ill. Could you imagine if our police, doctors or fire-fighters had to get somewhere quickly on foot? I don't think I need to comment on this. From my personal experience I realised how it's important to drive a car when I was living in Johanesburg in South Africa. I arrived there with my family when my daughter was only 4 months old and I couldn't drive at that time. Johanesburg is a very dangerous place to live. I couldn't just go for a walk, it was too dangerous. There was no public transport and I had to stay in the complex where we lived most of the time, and relay on other people to take me to a shop or the doctors or anywhere else. There I soon realised that I had to learn how to drive if I wanted a quality  life for my daughter and myself. Since I passed my driving test I can not understand how I used to live without a car before. I use my car every day everywhere I go and I absolutelly love it! ",38.00
931," Dear Mrs Helen Ryan, I received your letter congratulating me on having won the first prize in your competition. I am extremely excited about the opportunity to go to your camp in the USA. Firstly, I have to say that I am studying at University and I wonder if I could travel on July because of the exams I have on May. Apart from that I would not be able to travel there until the end of June. It does not matter to me whether I stay in  tent or  log cabin, but I would prefer  tent  to be much more in contact with  wild life and nature. The activities I'd like to do most are playing basketball and Climbing. The first one because I have been played basketball since the age of twelve and the second one because there are not many places where to go climbing in my city. Finally, I would  ask you if I have to take my own clothes with me or  you will provide me with some, and  the amount of money needed. I am looking forward to hearing from you soon. Yours Sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I received your letter last week in which you told me that you want to hear about my experience at the pop concert. It was terrible! We have a lot of problems from the beggining. The first one was the security. People in charge of security didn't arrive when they were supposed to. If it weren't a calm and quite public, we would have had troubles. Another problem was the band. They didn't want to play until the room were crowded. So that concert started an hour and a half latter. Everything was all right during the perform of the band, but at the end some espectators came up to the stage and made some damage to the band's instrument. The singer and the guitarist were so angry that they went out immediately leaving the public without the last part of the show. As you can see, hardly anything went well, but the lights and the sound -  both in wich I helped carrying things - were appropriate for the concert. Althought all these things, I gained a lot of experience and I could be near one of my favourite pop stars, which was the better experience I've ever had. Looking forward to hearing from you soon. Love, ",31.0
1040," Dear Mr Robertson, I am writing with reference to the trip to London on the 13th, 14th and 15th March. Firstly, I would like to thank you very much for the good programme you have organised for my class. We are especially looking forward to join the river trip to Greenwich and  the sightseeing by bus. Secondly, I have seen an advertisement in the times about the London Fashion and Leisure Show. It will be attended in the Central Exhibition Hall in London on Tuesday 14. My class and I are all interested in it and we would like to go there to have a visit. It will be  great opportunity for all of us because they will show the latest fashion, the leisure and sports wear, the make up and the different hairstyles. Furthermore, the admission for students is free. I have alredy thought about a changing of the programme. On Wednesday we could enjoy our free time  doing shopping, so on Tuesday afternoon we moved have time to go to visit the London Fashion and Leisure Show. I hope you will take my proposal in favoreable consideration. I am looking forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  It was dangerous but I knew I had to do it. What was so dangerous and why I had to do it? Now I will tell you in brief what exactly happened to me. It was a fantastic sunny day of August and my friends and I took a day off from work. There were just four of us. We all decided to go to have a day by the seaside not far away from Portsmouth. When we got there we were wearing our costumes. We lied on the sand under the sun, we had funny beach volley matches, interesting chats, but after two hours there, my friends decided to go swimming. For me, it was a big problem because I had never had swimming lessons before and my friends didn't know about that. I didn't want to tell them because I was sure they would have started laughing of me. So I took the decision to go and join them also if I knew that it would have been dangerous for my life. I walked very slowly through the water and I was very scared but I had to do it because if I didn't go my friends could understand that something was wrong with me. In the end fortunately everything went well as I didn't sink in the sea. After that day, I decided taking up swimming, so that I would have had no embarrass in the future trips to the seaside any more. ",35.00
1225," Dear Mrs Smith, Thank you for your letter. I am glad to help you for the organisation of the conference. I phoned to the tourist information  last week and I got some information about the accomodation of the students. I think we should book at the Palace Hotel. It is an outstanding building situated in the city centre. The Hotel is in a good position, 10 minutes walk from the conference and I think the best way to reach it is on foot. I am sure the students will enjoy walking in the streets of the town. The conference starts at 5 o'clock in the afternoon and finishes at 7 pm. I think they should wear smart dress, because there will be lots of interesting people and  important meeting. In conclusion, for the last day, I thought it will be very interesting for the students to visit the town and appreciate its monuments and art. On the other hand, if you prefer to have a relaxing day, you could have a pic-nic in the wonderful park. I hope my suggestion and Idea will help you to organise the meeting. I look forward to receiving your confirmation. Yours,  [SEP]  REPORT: TO: MR FROM: DATE: 21ST JUNE 2000 INTRODUCTION: As requested, the aim of this report is to assess the suitbility for a group of American students for the visit at the Etruscan Museum.

It contains lots of archeological Etruscans founded and some remains about  Etruscans neoropolis. The entrance fee is £7  each student. POSITIVE ASPECTS 1. The Museum is well-organised for tourists.

599," Dear Ms Helen Ryan, Thank you for the letter. It sounds great. I can't believe it but I'm really pleased to hear that I won first prize. Firstly I can travel only in July because I'm studying at college until the end of June and in August I'm travelling  Greece for one months. Secondly I would like to stay in log cabins because it would be more spacious and comfortable than tents. I'll tell you  two activities I chose. I would like to play tennis and swim. I'm belonging to a tennis club and it is the most favourite sports. I sometimes have a match with friends. I go swimming once a week. I like swimming because I can relax in water. Lastly, could I ask you something? How is the weather like in California? Do I need clothes with long sleeves? How much money should I bring? Can I change money for US dollars there? I'm looking forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  'Shopping is not always enjoyable.' Is it true or not? Generally women like shopping. They like looking for fashionable clothes, bags, shoes and so on. In the bargain season, all shops are full of people who  keen on finding stuffs which are good value for money. You can see battles between two people who want the same thing sometimes. The most interesting thing is that many men are waiting for their wives or girlfriends outside the shop during shopping. They don't fancy going into the crowdy shop. It is very boring and tiring to be kept waiting. For the women, too. If they can't find things which they expected, they go there just only to get tired. Shopping is enjoyable when you find exactly what you want in a calm shop but not always. ",33.0
111," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to complain about your musical show ""Over the Rainbow"". Last week I was on holiday at London and I was very dissappointed when I visited your theatre. First of all the show was supposed to start at 19.30, but it was delayed untill 20.15, and when the show finally began we were supriced to see that Danny Brook who was the star of the show, was not playing and someone else had replace him and he was really disappointing. Moreover, the advertisement says that discounts will be available with the price of the ticket, but when I asked for one they told me that there was not any. Last but not least, the advertisement says to visit your restaurant after the show, but when we went to the restaurant we realised that it was closed because the cook was ill. The advertisement says that it is going to be your perfect evening out, but it was not. it was a complete waste of time and money. That is why I would like to request  full refund of my money. Yours faithfully,   [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, but she was her best friend and she had to trust her. Anna told her again: ""Pat don't tell it to anyone please, especially to my brother everything will be ruin then"". and Pat answered: ""Don't wory I won't tell anyone"". The big secret was that Anna was prearing a suprice party for her brother, John and she didn't want anyone to know about it. She had told it to Pat though and that was extremely dangerous! Anna couldn't do anything though because she needed her help to give  the invitations. The party was set up to be in two days. The two days passed really fast and Anna was happy because Pat hadn't told anything to her brother, or so she thought! Pat went to Anna's and she seemed really unhappy. - ""Anna I have a confession to make"" Pat told  her and she started crying - ""What is it Pat?"" Anna asked and she started to worry. - ""I've told your brother about the party. I couldn't help it!, I'm so sorry!"" - ""What?"" Anna couldn't believe it, she was devastated, she started crying and told Pat ""Get out of my house, now!!!"" Pat left. Everything were destroyed the party and their friendship. ",32.0

This is another important part of our school life, and we should make a section to talk about lunch and where are the people go to eat their lunch or what they do? After we talk about lunch, we should take about  activities we are doing and the systems about the activities in school or outside school and make a little section of the School term, and what kind of sport the people like the most.

1062," Dear Mr Robertson, I am writing  you in relation to our next programme in London from 13th March to 14th March. First at all, it is a pleasure to say that the programme which you so kindly have prepared is very interesting, especially the visit to the National Art Gallery on Wednesday. On the other hand, our class has recently read an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show which takes place during our visit to London, on Tuesday 14th. This show is a good opportunity to know the latest fashions in several topics like make up, Hairstyles and leisure and sports wear. We think that it could be a great chance in order to know British fashion and probably it would give us good information for improving our studies. We would like to know if it could be possible to introduce a little change in our programme. Our question is: instead of going to the shopping on Tuesday, in the afternoon, could we go to the London Fashion and Leisure Show? I hope you will consider our suggestion. I look forward to hearing your reply. Yours sincerely, Classroom 5  [SEP]  How will be our future homes? Believe it or not, our lives are changing and becoming more complicated every day. The reason of all of this things is the impressionable introduction of the ""new technologies"", such as Computers,  Internet or WAP technologies. Of course, this new facilities will be introduced at home. Now, it is already possible to send our shopping list by the computer, and this opption, in the next  years, will become the most common once. The new technologies probably will produce a considerably revolution in some essencial parts of the house. For example, we will have got computerizated ovens, microwaves and freezers, or we will probably have got central heating controled through  Internet from our office. Despite all of this facilities, there are some home activities that will remain the same, fortunately. Who don't like to prepare a cup of tee with traditional kettles, waiting for the boiling watter? And to read the newspaper at breakfast instead of watching TV? Some pleasures must be untouchable! We are human beings at least, not ""new technological"" machines! ",32.00
92," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing this letter to complaint about the musical show that  Circle Theatre company played  few days ago. Anything the advertisement said was correctly done. The first thing that annoyed me were the forty-five minutes we were waiting for the beginning. It is a great fault of responsability for a theatre like yours to have a delay like this one. Secondly, an other point that disappointed me was the actor that played the main role. He was not Danny Brook, and the main reason that I came to see this show was the possibility to see him acting. I am a fan of him. When I went to get the ticket, and the women said me that the discounts were not available I knew that it wouldn't be a good night. Finally, the restarant were I would like to have dinner with friends after the show was closed against what was announced in the advertisement. Nobody told us about the reasons of the problems. These are the reasons why I am complaining, and I would like to know if there will be some money back. I will be waiting  news from you. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Perhaps, modern technology has changed my life style but I don't think so because I was born in the period of modern developments. Since I was born I have lived involved of technological instruments like personal computers, mobile phones, television, etc. And the development of them doesn't worries me, like people  against technology. The only thing I can say about technology is that  has driven my life. Modern technology attracts my atention, and this is the reason why I have chosen an electronic caree. I think technology doesn't change the life style. Is the life style or necessities from people what make technology develop. All kind of industrial machines are created to solve problems, improve other machines or to don't waste so many time. But these ones bring new problems that must be solved by others. ",24.0
1012," Dear Mr Robertson. Thank you very much for taking us to London. This is a big opportunity to discover the capital. Thoug, a few of us would like to consider the ""London fashion and leisure show"". This is going to take place on tuesday march 14 at 10.00 to 19.00. Could you, if we may ask so, re-organise our visit to the museum and also to the shopping center. However, none of us wishes to miss all the attractions planned in  forecast. Perhaps, we could spend our free time at the museum before going to the shop center. This is a very important stay over three days. Every one hopes to enjoying himself and comes back with a lot of knowledge. I thank you very much for hearing my request. I apologise for any inconvenience it could make. I am certain you would think over about that particular visit to ""the London fashion and leisure show"". On behalf of all the students. Yours truly.  [SEP]  What do famous people wish? Do they want to be famous and ignored? Or do they want to be persecuted buy the media? There are plenty of good things about being famous. You do not have a precarious life. You are rich and be-loved. Of course, it does not mean you deserve to be persecuted all the time. Perhaps we could call it the ""rough of the smooth"". However, to have his photos taken and showed on television and   newspapers increases your popularity. It is the way you may consider magnificent wages as it should fit your fame. I might also miss the point. You might be a Princess, a politician or a footballer; but are not doing it for any fame. You were born with the talent, sometime with the title. You never wished to be famous that much. Whateaver you do, the journalist should not follow you every second. Every one deserves to be given the right of a private life. ",27.00
80," 16/12/2000 Dear Jane Clark, First of all, I'd like you to know that the whole organization was nearly excellent. I spent two nice days at the festival full of art. The idea of making the festival ""international"" was very good. I could find the opportunity to watch the artists from different countries, but there could have been stars from more than 6 countries. The jazz, classical and rock concerts were great despite some of the concert halls were too small.  Plays and films I watched were also excellent, but more could be on the stage next year. I joined the art exhibitions and saw interesting pictures. The dance shows made  sight for our sour eyes, they were really fascinating. I learned so many things about the writers and their ideas,  their life styles by talking to them. Beyond all these, the application of joining  all  activities by one nice-priced ticket was excellent; because it saved you from  buying one ticket for each activity. Next year, I think you should increase the number of shows, concerts and others,  also the time spent at the festival (for example: at least 5 days), then everything would be perfect. Thank you for making a great festival which made all the art activities come together. Yours Sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Jennifer, I'm glad that everything's going on well there. It's the same here. I've got too many exams nowadays, but that's all. By the way, it would be better If you wrote quite often to me. The things you wrote about the rules made me think for a long time and I understood that some really don't make any sense! The more you obey the rules, the better person you are! Our school is really very diciplined, especially about our clothes and behaviours. I understand the second part, but I can't get the reason of wearing in white an dark blue only. Do we become the ""perfect one"" then? Then again, we have to obey all these rules. It can be said that I'm much more free at home. I'm allowed to do whatever I want at my room. I can't go out at nights easily, but that is not something that I mind about. There are three main things that are very important for my family: respect, honesty and trust. I think I show these three to them. Don't ever forget to write to me, okay? Love, ",31.00
858," Dear Ms. Helen Ryan I am very happy to here from you that I have won first prize in your competition - twe weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. and I am writing for my information to tell you. Firstly, I will be able to travel only in July because I go to univercity and I normaly spend the most of  time for work. to do. and I have holiday only in July. Secondly, It is accommodation. I prefer in tents. When I go to camp, I stay in a log cabins all the time so I would like to try  different way to stay, this time. And I choose phtograghy and tennis from the activities list. I am taking photograghy courses at univercity and I started tennis, when I was 10 so I am good at bouth of them. Endly, I have questions about clothes and money. How much money should I take and should I take only casual clothes and trainers? I am looking forward to hearing from you. Your sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Kim. Thank you for your lovely letter and I hope you are well. The other day, I worked at a pop concert to help. It was really  interesting than I expected. My job at behind the stage was helping  make-up, hare and clothes staylist. It was very hard. The singers often changed them clothes and them make-up was easy to be off because of the sweat. It was different from  I did  at college. There was no time to rest. But I met a lot of famous singer and spoke to them. In front of the stage was so many people and they couldn't see them very well, but I was at very near from the stage and I could see them just there. You like pop music, don't you? So, don't go to a concert! Work at a concert! That's much more exciting. Anyway, shall we meet sometime? We haven't met each other  so long time and I'll tell you more story of this. Write soon, Bye Bye. ",23.0
292," Dear Sir or Madam, I recently went to The Circle Theatre in order to see Over the Rainbow, and it has been quite deceiving. I am writing to you to complaint about five or six utterly outrageous facts. In the advertisement for the show, which I have picked up in the hall of the theatre, are there about five points which were not respected. To begin with, as far as the starring is concerned, Danny Brook should have performed  the main character, and I saw at the very beginning of the show that he did not. Insofar as I came here especially to see him play, I have been very deceived, and this could be the understatement of the year, inasmuch as he is my favorite actor. Apart from it, the show should have begun at 19.30 and it started at 20:15! Could you explain  me the reasons of such a huge late? Thirdly, the ad mentionned possible discounts. Personnaly speaking, I didn't saw it and even didn't heard of it: I have asked about it, but nobody seemed to know anything concerning discounts. On top of that, the restaurant was closed for renovations! How can you dare putting an advertisement for a theatre restaurant if you obviously know that is closed? To put it in a nutshell, and quite honestly, I would like to emphasize on the fact that I did not spent a ""perfect evening out"" at all,  as it is mentionned in the ad. For all these reasons, I would like, dear Sir or Madam, that you give me my money back. I am looking forward to hear from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. If only Paul had knew it before... Everything had begun when Paul went downstairs of the Heavy Sleep. As he closed his eyes, he started to travel across the dark paths of his councience. He went through  valleys, plains and mountains of the Dream Landscape. He finally arrived in Faerie, a country of elder elves and strong white-bearded dwarves While he was wandering in the depths of the forest he felt a little tired and sat on a grey huge stone, on  top of which he could stare  the whole woods. All of a sudden, a weird creature popped into his dream. She was taller than a dwarf and as thin as a dying tree. Paul was wandering wether this beast could be offensive when the creature said these words ""I am glad to meet you, Paul."" The boy could not beleive to what he was hearing. How did the beast knew his name? ""You see, I am a mere product of your mind, but I would like to go out of the Heavy Sleep. Please, bring me with you, in your reality!"" At these words, Paul suddently awoke. Relieved, he thought that bringing the creature in his world would have revealed the existence of Faerie, and with it, threatened the ecology of the Dream Landscape, when he heard a creepy sound under his bed. He jumped out of his room, locked the door and found his brother, Pat. He told him about his adventures and asked him not to repeat it. Unfortunately...one our after , a local zoo  arrived and caught the creature in order to put her in a cage. There she died because of  not having  Faerian food necessary to her survival. This is how human destroys what is good and burns the Woods of Dream. This is how mankind can't be relied on. This is how secrets are betrayed, and the result of it. ",35.0
143," Dear sir, I'm writing to express my complaint about the organization of the musical show I went to last Saturday evening. According to your advertisement, there should have been Danny Brook, starring  all the scenes. Instead, you changed  actor without any warning, so I didn't find my favourite Danny Brook, with my total disappointment, as his substitute couldn't catch him up at all. And what about the starting time? I had to wait for about an hour, as the show started at 20.15 instead of 19.30. Another thing that made me angry was that I couldn't have a discount. I was very annoyed about it: I only expected the discounts you had promised on the advertisement and, as I am a university student, I would have a right on it. At the top of everything, your theatre restaurant was closed because it was being restructurated, so I couldn't have my dinner either! It was a terrible evening out, so I ask you for a refund for all the troubles you caused me. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Most people think modern technologies aren't so positive as they are often showed . My personal theory is completely different. I have always a good approach with all of the most recent invenctions or any other kind of modern applications. We live in the age of personal computers, of  internet, of the mobile phones, and now for me it's impossible to think of a world without them. It' already four years since I bought my first cellular phone ( then I changed it many times) and it is always very useful for me: everyone can speak with me wherever I am. When, for example, I go abroad I feel closer to my friend and to my family than before. Anyway, the thing that has most changed my daily life is the personal computer and, expecially,  internet. For example, now I'm writing my thesis, but I use my pc everytime I have to write a document in a perfect form. Then, surfing in  internet is becoming my passion: it's incredible how many unthinkable activities you can do with it. It's simply fantastic! ",30.0
616," Dear Mr. Ryan: I am writing in connection with the information requested, concerning the two-week trip I have won in the competition. Firstly, I was asked the time my trip would be and I have come to a conclusion that the only time I will be able to go is in July because during this very month I have my winter break both from work and school and that is when I will be free to go. About accomodation in tents or log cabins, I would enjoy much more being in  tents as I believe  is the right type of accomodation for going camping? Another point mentioned was the choice of activities. I would like to try sailing as I have never sailed before and also climbing as I enjoy hiking a lot. I actually have much resistance and balance so that will help me in both activities. Now, I would like to request some information about clothes and money. What type of clothes and how much money should I take with me? I look forward to receiving your reply and hope the information above will helpful towards the preparation for the weeks in subject. Yours sincerely Gabriela Matos  [SEP]  Right size, right colour Men tease women as being shop-cravers and for having shopping as the nicest passtime. However that impression is not always true. Everyone enjoys wearing nice new clothes, however do we really like the process of chosing them? At times, it is not only the matter of having to make a choice but the trouble of finding something, which can kill a lot of time and specially when your  doesn't fit with the in fashion. The colour along with the style and size, blue or red, long or short, medium or large. What is more, we can say that price is often very off-putting as well. Most people usually go shopping for something which is affordable, and many times they find, for example, a dress, they like a lot but they cannot buy it because it is terribly expensive. Then, I consider  a pain having to go around some more still thinking of that same dress. Finally, you always talk yourself into some piece of clothing but that ended up being a tiring day of going in and out of fitting rooms and figuring out discounts. etc. Is that enjoyable? ",35.0
995," Dear Mrs Ryan, I have just received your letter and I'm writing back to tell you how much it made me happy to win this prize and to give you the answers to your questions. I would like to travel in July because I can only see my family during the month of August. Concerning the accomodation, I prefer to live in log cabins finding them much more comfortable than tents! Finally, I decided to choose singing and basketball because my friends say I'm good at both. Singing has always been a hobby and takes an important part in my life. Singing relaxes me when I am stressed before exams or competitions. Basketball is simply my favourite sport. It makes me feel very free and makes me forget all my daily problems. I actually have won a basketball prize when I was young...! to finish off, I would like to ask you how much money is needed for my personal shopping  and what kind of clothes I should take. I hope I haven't been too ""demanding"". Yours sincerely, Marthe Ouellet  [SEP]  Making a short video about daily life is an enjoyable but difficult thing to do. We would concentrate on students imagination, creation and talent. to do that, it is more interesting to go to art, music and drama classes. Effectively, in these classes, students express themselves more than in other classes. However, it is important to observe students attention and therefore we should film them during an exam (but only for a short period of time) A school teaches you how to be polite and respectful. The cafeteria is an interesting place to go because one can see if students respect food and if they remain polite towards each other. It is important to remember that short shots should be taken for each subject. Students walking and talking in corridors should be filmed so that we also show how students relax between two lessons. I think these are the best advices I can give and hope that one understands the main idea which is to concentrate more on students attitudes than on lessons. ",31.0
110," Dear Sir/Madam, I'm writing to complain about the show, that I have recently attended to at your theatre. During my visit there occurred some problems, that made my evening completely disappointing. Firstly, as I wanted to buy a ticket, I was informed that no discounts were available. However, the serious problems appeared later. Not only the play started 45 minutes after it was planned, but as the actors eventually appeared at the stage, have I also seen, that Danny Brook was replaced by a different actor, who was very disappointing in his role. To make matters even worse, the theatre restaurant was closed after the show, without any information  given about the reason of it's closure. As you see, my evening in your theatre absolutely wasn't perfect. I hope I will get a full refund. I am looking forward to hearing from you soon. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Have you ever thought of a year 2100? Do you think, that  world will be different from  current world then? I would answer ""yes"" for both questions. And if I were asked, what will be completely different in  year 2100, I would say: clothes. Most of the scientists, when asked about the Earth in a hundred years claim, that it is going to be absolutely scorching here then. In my opinion, if the weather is so good people will very quickly forget about any winter clothes. What is more,  ground will be so hot, that going will only be possible in huge shoes, which should be massive, but not heavy at all. Another effect of the scorching weather could be, that people won't be allowed to get out of the building unless they wear specially designed caps or hats, made of materials, that aren't known yet. On the whole, we can only predict what clothes will be like in  year 2100. But in case my predictions are right, maybe you should buy a new pair of shorts? ",31.0

First of all, it is  great idea to have a this kind of festival. I enjoyed it so much. But, there are three things which I would like to tell you. Firstly. There were stars and artists from only six countries. I supposed to see quite various nationality. Secondly, I actually liked  Jazz, rock and classical concerts very much. However, some concert halls were too small for the many people so we couldn't have a enough space. thirdly. I would like to you to consider about having more plays and films next year. It would be nicer. Otherwise, the price was really reasonable for all :events the weekend. I was satisfied with that. And if there was musical event. It would be greatful. I hope the next one will be better. And I would like to thank you about making this festival. I look forward to  next festival very much. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Lula Hello. How are you doing? I hope you're well. It's nice to hear about your class. It's quite interesting. Let me tell you some rules at school in my country. Actually. We have quite strict rules. When I was a student, I wasn't allowed to wear any fashionable clothes. Only It was like a formal clothes. And we couldn't wear any colorful clothes and socks. Also our hair style was the same as everyone. It's really strict. At home. There is one thing I'd like to change. I'm not allowed to sleep at my friend's house. I really like chatting all night with my friends. But I can't  it. I'm pursuading my mum, perhaps. The school rules in my country are more strict than  your country. Anyway. If you want to know about something of our country. I'm glad to tell you more. I'm looking forward to getting your letter soon. Thank you. Take care of yourself. Loves, ",23.00
523," Dear Sir! I am writing with reference to your theatre. I would like to apologise  you for my controversary opinnion but I feel really disappointed. Firstly I would like to explain  you where the problem is. I came to London for a short journey to meet new poeple and to have a meeting with an English culture. I've seen your advertisment which had recommended the play 'Over the rainbow' and I enjoyed it very much. I decided to go to the Circle Theatre with  hope that your show will provide me  all these emotions that I have been looking for in Great Britain. Please forgive me but you didn't do your best. I heard about Danny Brook in Poland and I wanted to see him on the scene but it wasn't hardly possible. There was a change of the leader-actor what annoyed me indeed. Further more the show was to begin at about 19.30 but it didin't. You were 45 minutes late. Waiting was horrible. On the advertisment was written 'DISCOUNTS AVAILABLE' shall I ask you one question? - Why they weren't available? Everybody were schocked and I was trying to keep the faith. I didin't expect more surprises at your Theatre. Nevertheless after the show I was very hungry so I went to the theatre restarrant and what  I've seen? A poster: ""Closed because of the illness of the chef."" There were some more disappointing situations about which I don't want to write. Eventually - you offered a wonderflul evening but I must say that if I had known that it is going to be like that I wouldn't have wasted my time. I feel honoured to write this letter and I feel the oportunity. I would like to recieve back my money. I am looking forward to hearing you from you. Your faithfuly  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed your daily life? The entrance in to the new millennium brought us a lot of changes. Many things have been replaced by the others which are more helpful and useful. The most important thing for me is using a computer. The main adventage is that, it provides you  all the informations that you need. For example you have to write an Essay about  2-nd world war. You get into the internet and you're looking for those facts and informations which will help you to do your homework. Searching in the computer's memory takes about 1 minute so it is very fast. Further more you can play with the computer, and unfortunetly this advantage has especially changed my life. Playing the games takes me a lot of time and it became a bad habit. I have no time for learning and for domestic works. On the other hand playing games and using a computer wide my brain so as you can see this modern staft has got many advantages and disadvantages. The next thing that has changed my life is a mobile telephone. This little thing brings a lot of satisfaction. It is very useful either. I have got a steady contact with my parents and friends. I have no problems with changing the time of  meeting because I can always phone. But actually it is boring when you're almost always under observation. The modern technologies brought to my life a lot of changes. It is even seen in the domestic works. For example I've got at home a very modern and special machine which irons hardly itself. My mother is happy and I am happier because I don't need to put an effort to iron the clothes. I only press the button and everything is going alright. These are the main reasons why I admit that technology has changed my life and other people's life. I admire  people who made those machines and I would like to give them the tribute. They made my life better. ",26.0
1211," Dear Mrs. Smith, I am writing in reply to your letter about the internation student conference. The hotel which we have reserved for your group is the Palace Hotel. It is not far from our college, taking 20 minutes by car. It would be a good idea to take a taxi from the hotel to the college because the total  members of your group are 4 and  taxi fare would not be expensive. There is a taxi rank opposite the hotel. Regarding the end-of-conference party on Thursday, it starts at 7 p.m. in the garden of the college. You can wear either casual dresses or fancy ones because we have a fancy-dress competition and the raffle is a bottle of French champaign. On Friday afternoon, it has set to be a free time. Therefore, you can go shopping in the town centre which is near the college. Many beautiful and traditional souvenirs can be found there. The other suggestion is going to the flower market where is very famous for tourists because it covers 2 acres and there are plenty of flowers to buy. Moreover, it is the biggest flower market in this area. I look forward to meeting you soon and hope you have a safe journey. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Invented Light There are many sources of light in this world such as sunlight, moonlight, candle light. Some of them are natural whereas the others are not. Owing to  increasing demand of light for more activities, the natural source is not adequate. There, electric light has invented. Nowadays, the electric light has been becoming part of our lives, especially during the night. Whatever we do at night, we need the electric light. Have you ever imaged how this world would be if there was no electric light? It must have been a big impact on industry, agriculture and our lifestyle. Think about when the electricity in your house got a short circuit. Do you feel uncomfortable? Could you do anything much without light? In addition, the electric light is the manuscript of other electric equipments and they has become an important part of our life, too. I think we should be grateful that we have got the electric light for comforting our lifestyle. ",30.00
1085," Dear Mr. Robertson Thank you for your good programme for  English class, especially  it is well-organised and has many different places we can go and we can see. All of us in  English class look forward to visiting these places. However, we'd like to ask about London Fashion and Leisure Show that we've seen an advertisement  on this week college newspaper. We would appreciate it if you could give us a chance to go there while we are visiting in London. It should be a great opportunity for us because we can see the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and Hairstyles, As you know, this year is our final year and most of us would like to get a job straight away after this course. We've been worried about our future career and we believe that we need some preparation for it such as  dress and hairstyle for an interview. And mostly, it should  a great opportunity for the Art students who are attending English class. Most of students in our class are studying Fashion as full-time. Especially, it does not cost  at all for students. But the only problem for the show is the date which is on Tuesday 14 March from 10.00 to 19.00. As we're considering your programme we're supposed to go   Science Museum and shopping. We're thinking that we can go to these place the next following day. But Mr. Robertson, these our suggestions are depended on your programme, we're just suggesting. Again we're so sorry that we give you an inconvience for your plan and thank you for considering us. We are look forward to hearing from you Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  The Home of the Future. Have you ever thought about our future home? Living in a high building! But we could have everying we want to. Home might be a mixture with moden styles and  natural view as well. These days a lot of contries have been worried about lands that can't have enough place to build houses. The prises for lands are getting increasing it's because of this reason. So I think that the future home could be considered this points. I mean most of home are going to be in a building like a flat. Maybe it is right say that in a flat instead of a building. I believe there are a lot of high buildings now in Japan. Most of them are flats which have at lest 20 Floors. It means  Japanese are planning for the future home. But what my imagination is that these flats'll have many functions such as offices, leisure centre, shopping centre even school. Because we are living in  computerlised life, so we'll able to do most things at home or these flats'll have these places as well. But one more thing, I believe these flats'll have a park for people who'll be living in there. And because it'll be a big building we'll  able to see a whole view through the window. In conclusion, our future home will have a natural view like these days home and give people a new technological home life. ",21.00

I am looking forward to receiving your answer and don't forget that it is a surprice birthday party. Yours faithfuly,  [SEP]  Family life in our days is very important because both of parents work and they haven't any time for  children. In addition childrens have so much lessons at school that they doesn't have enough spare time to see their parents, when they are in home. In spide  that fact there are of course many families especialy in small towns which eat lunch all together and they they solve their problem all together. Parents play with  children and have fun. And the difference in that  children is effectivily when they grown up and want to make a family they do the same with their parents and make a happy family. Besides that the most importand  is that this children have an easy teenaties and they haven't go pshycological problems and they are useful in sociaty. To sum up family life is the most important think for childrens phycological wold which help them in their education, job and their married in future. So we also try to make our time creative when we are with our children. ",22.0
1071," Dear Mr. Robertson, I am representing an English class, which is going on a three-day London tour. We would like to thank you for organising our programme. We really appreciate your attention. The programme you suggest is versatile and full of interesting activities. We are eager to attend  National Art Gallery and Science Museum. But we would like to make our suggestion, if you don't mind. We have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and would like to go to this exciting show. It will take place in the Central Exhibition Hall on Tuesday on the 14th of March from 10 a.m. to 19 p.m. Our students will have a great opportunity of seeing the latest fashion, as this unique show is held only once a year. What's more, new hairstyles and leisure and sports wear are presented there. And apart from it, this activity is free of charge. We would be very grateful if you could change our programme for Tuesday afternoon. We are thinking here particularly of the fact, that we can go to the show, instead of shopping. We sincerely hope that you will consider our suggestion. Faithfully yours,  [SEP]  We tend to think that famous people, such as politicians and film stars are very happy and satisfied with their life. But such an attitude is wrong. It is quite obvious, that celebreties can't lead a normal life, as they are constantly followed by reporters, what makes their life miserable. The first point I would like to make is that a private life of a celebrity is open to  public. I am thinking here particularly of the fact that every event and action is wildely discussed in the mass-media. It is common knowledge, that such an attention inevitably tells on relationships in the family. Another aspect is that  children of famous people suffer a lot from this attention. They can't communicate with ordinary children and attend ordinary schools. And last, but not least is the fact that famous people can't express their emotions, show their real feelings to  public. And it tells on their attitude to life and on their character. I would like to stress that very often famous people become reserved, bad-tempered and angry with the world for interfering into their lives. I would like to sum up by saying that every person, either famous or not, deserves to have a private life without being followed or disturbed. ",31.00
1221,"  Mrs Smith, I received your letter this morning and I would like to thank you for your interest in the Conference. I hope I can answer your questions. At First, this international student conference has the intension of explain to students how important is the education. In addition to this, we choose the luxuery Palace Hotel which is comfortable enough and in a good location. The Palace Hotel is located in the centre of the city, so you can go by train, by bus or by car. I suggest you should go by train and go out in the Museum Station. The Conference will happen in the Hotel, which is so much easier. The Conference, not being modest, it is a quite well organized. It will starts at eight in the morning and will finish around five in the afternoon. I suggest you should wear something informal. Even though we want to make things as more comfortable as possible to our students. I am very happy that you want to know  my area, although I am afraid an afternoon is not enough. However, if you want, you can call me and I can show you some interesting places. I will be very glad. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Affecting Our Lifes Cars, boats, motobikes, airplanes: Who did never use this once? This is a good question. The humans seems always that they are running and the fastest of this inventions is certainly, the airplane. At First, when Santos Dummont invented the airplane, he probably didn't think how the people could transform his creation. In this world, where the nations fight to be the better one couldn't be diferent: the airplane became the most important thing in the war. Unfortunately, it was used to kill a lot of people. However, the invention of the airplane has brought us some facilities. How could a person come from Brazil to Australia ? Maybe by boat, but it could take too long! The best way is definetely, by air. After this invention travel around the world is so much easier. Now, we have to say thanks and congratulate all the creators who invented facility things for us. So, the airplane is definitely an important invention, because it have changed people's life in wars. Until now, it is being important in the transport of thousands and thousands of people around the world. Let's congratulate Santos Dummont! ",25.00
719," Dear Helen Ryan, I am writing  you in order to answer your questions and to get some information I would like to have. First of all I want you to know I am really happy about the prize. The only problem is that like I am a student I can travel only during  holidays, in July. Refering to accommodation I would rather to stay in  tents because I have never gone on camping so I would like to have the experience. I am not really keen on art that is why I  prefer doing some sports like surfing and sailing. If I have to be honest, I would say I have never practised none of them. Yet, I would like to try them because my city is too far from the sea so I don't have many opportunities of doing them. I would appreciate  if you could tell me what kind of clothes and how much money I should take. Besides, I wonder if I will share the tend or not and if I have to take it from here or if it will be provided by you. I am looking fordward to hearing from you. Yours Natalia Lorena Kraus  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I'm really happy because I've finally received your letter. If I didn't told you  the experience of the pop concert in detail in my last letter  was because I didn't have time. Please don't be angry. I will tell you everything right now. As few months ago I chated, by  internet, to a nice guy from Buenos Aires, who happened to be one of the member of ""Los Pericos"". We started mailing each other and became good friends. They have to make a concert in my city so when they arrived here my friend phoned me and invited me  where they were preparing the concert. The problem was that one of the technics was from England and nobody there spoke nor a word in English so I was asked to be the interpreter. It was so great!! Not only because I learnt a lot about concerts and music, but also because I practised my English. I hope you are not angry any more after this letter. I'm looking fordward to hearing from you. love, ",32.0
1112," Dear Mr. Robertson, The trip that you planned for us, students, it's a great chance to meet new people and visit a beautiful city like London. Your programme is excellent because it tries to offer to the students the best way to spend our time without wasting time in silly places or events. We'd like to thank you because the kind of happening shows how you are dedicated with our school and the students that study there. It's great to visit especially the Science Museum because of its expositions. But there's something that I'd like to ask. The London fashion and Leisure Show will start on Tuesday. It's a great opportunity for us because there will be expositions of the latest fashions, of the new hairstyles,  of the new leisure and sports clothes and people teaching how to  make up. Our suggestion is that you could change the day of the leisure time to the shopping in the afternoon. By this way, the leisure time would be on Tuesday and we would be able to go to the London Fashion . Thanks for the attention and we're waiting for your answer. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Famous People x  Media Famous people are special for the rest of the society. They form opinions and invent new fashion styles. Nowadays, the media is expanding its ways of communication so they need more information. The media is starting to get into the private life of these famous people. It's important to respect other people lives because it can cause serious problems in the family of the person or in his life. If the famous person doesn't mind in being filmed in his personal life there's no problem. But if the politicians or the film stars ask for privacity the media has to respect . Everybody likes to be with your family without any reporter or photographer . In summary, the best thing to do is try to extract from these people their best qualities and not try to find things that could irritate them like familiar problems or personal problems. The respect is essential. They deserve to have a private life like any common person. ",27.00
211," Dear Sir or Madam: I am writing this letter I  order to complain  my unpleasant experience in your theatre. Two days ago, I went to see the musical show ""over the rainbow"" at your theatre. The advertised beginning time is 19:30. But due to some unknown reasons, the play didn't start until 20:15. The audience were anxious and bored. What made things even worse was that the leading actor Danny Brook did not appear at the stage at all. A second-class actor took the place of him. We felt totally disappointed and cheated. After the show, I was hungry and tired. As your poster suggested, I intended to rest for a while at your restaurant. But when I got there, it had closed. In addition, the conductor didn't offer me any discounts as you had advertised in the poster when I bought the ticket. I am sorry to say that I do not enjoy the evening at your theatre at all. I hope you can pay me the money back as compensation. I am waiting for your reply. Yours Faithfully   [SEP]  Modern technology has changed my daily life in two ways. First with a lot of advanced techniques being put into practical use, our living condition becomes more and more convenient and comfortable. When we look around in the house, it is easy to find things like these:  microwave oven, TV set, computer, etc. All these  equippments are the applications of modern science. When you are planning to travel, you can choose  train, car or even  plane as your  transportation. Without the development of modern technology, it may take your several years to reach the destination. Second, Modern technology makes communication much easier and more enjoyable. With the spreading use of  Internet, people living in different parts of the world can chat with each other through the web. And, we can also share important informations with other people. The development of information technology has changed the world into ""an earth village"". Modern technology plays an important role in our life. I am hoping to devote myself into the development of it. ",27.0
1108," Dear Mr Robertson, I am writing to express my pleasure about the successful programme that you have prepared for our school, especially the excellent idea to visit the National Art Gallery. In addition, I would like to inform you about an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show, which my classmates and I have seen. We are really interested in  latest fashions and new hairstyles, but also we are keen on knowing about leisure and sports clothes and  especially girls enjoy seeing the different kinds of making up. Furthermore, we have been informed that students are allowed to see this exhibition without paying money. This event takes place in  Central Exhibition Hall in London, on Tuesday on  14th of March. I would be grateful if you would consider my suggestion. If you agree to  visit  this exhibition, we will spend our day there, thus we should cancel the shopping, but we will be able to purchase some presents  next day, as you have not organised a specific plan. I look forward to your answer. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. I had to hit a human being and unfortunately, although I respect every form of life humans, animals and plants, I managed to hit a burglar. Three months ago, I cannot forget this day, my parents visited my aunt at hospital as she was ill. On this day I was really exhausted as I had been studying for 8 hours. I decided to stay at home and listen to music. I switched off the lights and I was sitting in bed. While I was listening to my favourite cassette, I heard a strange noise. Immediately I opened my door and... I could not believe my eyes! A short man stood in front of me! Without any warning he pushed my arms. I shouted as I pained. I realised that he was very strong. But I was faster and more intelligent than him. I ran quickly and I managed to escape from him, I found one hidden wooden spoon and while he was passing in front of me I hit him. To my relief I managed to survive! ",34.00
496," 17th June 2000 The manager of the Circle theatre. Dear sir or madam, I am writing to you in response of your advertisement about the show of the Circle Theatre. I have to say that I am realy disappointed bout your advertisement because you mentioned some points that are not true. Firstly I'd like to complain about the actor of the show. On your advertisement you say that Danny Brook and Tina Truelove are starring in the play but I am sure that they never appear on the stage that night. Secondly another ploblem was about the starting time, according to your advertisement the play starts at 19.30 and instead it started on 20:15, this is about almost an hour delay. Moreover, there were several prices about the tickets and an available discount, Something that wasn't true. We didn't get any discount. Furthermore On your advertisement you say that visitors can visit the theatre restaurant after the play, but the restaurant was closed and I'd like to know why. I am very disappointed about the whole situation and I am not happy  to ask for a money refund. Looking forward to hearing from you.  [SEP]  The 21st Century is also known as the gold century of high technology and science. And I must admit that this is true. Many thinks have changed within the last 100 years. Technology - along with science - has made huge steps and has turned into a growing monster which doesn't have an ending. Every single day we hear about new products, new methods, new technological miracles which have turned up side down our daily lives. The simpliest example of modern high tech is the introduction of the computer - or better known as the P.C -. Reserches have shown that almost every single house owns a P.C. Some people use them for their job because they do need it, but others, like children, use it just for fun. Other examples that may not look like huge technological miracles are the T.V, the microwave, the video the satelite , the cd player and hundreds of others. All thease play a serious role in our daily life with out  ever understanding it. All of us have turned into pathetic, technological, robots. Those things can and do make our lifes easier and more comfortable, but the call us away from our friends, our families and more over they lead us to madness and cut  any relantionship with everything that suround us and keep us in life.

652," Dear Miss Ryan, I am very glad received your letter, and very happy won first prize in your competition. I am writing to answer your question and ask  further information. First of all, I am a high school student, so I only have four weeks vacation on July. I would like to travel on July. Secondly, for me, the best way to live in  outdoor is in tents, because that will be a good chance to learn a lot of knowledge about  planets and  animals as well. Moreover, I am good at play basketball, in fact, I am the captain in  basketball team which is one of the best teenagers team in my city, and I also like singing. I play piano very well.

816," Dear Ms Ryan, Thank you very much for your letter which informed me that I have won the first prize for two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. Here are some information as requested. Please noted that I can only travel in July because of  summer holiday shut down. It would be any day but please let me know nearner the time. I would prefer the log cabins than tents. I think the log cabin is more fun & exciting. The activities that I would like to do are painting and playing a Golf. I have won a first prize for painting when I was at High School, and won a third prize of playing Golf for a Charity. Could you please tell me for what sort of clothes do I need and how much money to take. I look forward to hear from you and if you need more information, please do not hesitate to contact me. Yours sincerely Sunee Boonliang-Hampson  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable. Shopping is an ordinary way of life. We always need fresh food such as vegetables, fruits, milk and etc. At least most people will do their shopping twice a week for a fresh food. You might think shopping is enjoyable but I don't think it  always enjoyable. You have to try to park your cark first which sometime the space are fulled and after you have parked your car and went in the supermarket the product you wanted have run out so you have to changes your plan for dinner or going to another supermarket to facing a long queue. that make you whole day for shopping which was not fun at all.

234," Dear sir, I'm sorry to tell you, that I'm really disappointed of your advertisment for the musical show in the Circle Theatre. First of all, I was really looking forward to see one of my favourite actors Danny Brook in the show, but you had a different actor, what disappointed me very much. Also, the show didn't start in time, it started half an hour later. And you have written in your advert, that there would be discounts available, what wasn't possible this evening. After the show we wanted to visit the restaurant, but it was closed because of  painting-works inside the restaurant. Finally we had no  perfect evening at all! And  of these circumstands, I would like to have a part of my money back. I hope you understand my concern. Yours Faithully, Brigitte Beschle  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Because he likes to tease people. So, it was last summer, we were on a short trip with our class to a adventure-park. We had a lot of fun. Until we came to a big cave, where you could walk through. It was quiet scary for me, but I said to myself, come on you can do it. I walked  first with Pat and two of my friends. But suddenly, there were only Pat and I left. We lost the others. So I tried to get not in  panic, but  no chance. I was so worried  not to find the way out, that I started to scream and cry. First, Pat started to laugh, but as he realized, that I didn't stop crying, he comfort me until I was calming down. And after a while we found the way out. I ask him, not to tell anybody that I cried. He said, 'shure no problem'. But next day, back in the classroom, some of the students looked at me and started to laugh. After that  was all clear, Pat and secrets. ",27.0
660," Dear Mrs. Helen Ryan, I'm writing about the competition you organised. I have just received a letter from you where you say I won the first prize in you competition. I'm very glad about that and I also want to ask you a few questions. I can only travel to California this July because  it will be  my winter holidays. Before and after this period is impossible for me: I have classes and I also have to work. About the accommodation, I prefer to stay in tents. I have always dreamed about going camping and staying in a tent. Now my dream will finally come true. I think this way is better to keep in touch with the nature. I would like to do photografy and swimming. I love to take photos but I don't have  techinique. I would like to learn more about it. I have always swam and I can say I'm good on it. I would like to know what kind of clothes I will need to take, if it's cold out there and about the money. How much money do you think I have to take to buy food and anything else I will need? Do you have any idea about how much we spend per day? I'm looking forward from hearing from you, Yours sincerely, Raquel Soares  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable We can hear many items people saying that when they are upset or stressed they like to go shopping. Is a kind of relief for them. Of course it is good to buy things for ourselves, like clothes, jewelery, anything. Specially if we don't have to worry about money. It's good to walk around looking  all the news in the stores. But, sometimes, go shopping can have other effects on you. It can stress you. For example, when the place is crowded and noisy and you can't even move easily to look around. When you can't find what you are looking for anywhere. When you buy something you were looking for a long time and, when you arrive at home, you discover some deffect on it and have to go back to the store to complain. It is just terrible when the sellers don't treat us well sometimes we just give up and never come back to that store. And, a really bad thing is, after buying everything you wanted and feeling very happy with all that, you realize that you spent more money than you should ... So, after all this, I suggest that before you decide to go shopping to feel better you should think of all the problems you may have while you are shopping or the big headache you can have after it. It would probably be better if you just go shopping when you really need and, to relax, you can talk to a friend, read a book or listen to good music. Remember: go shopping is not always the better choice. It can be very unpleasant sometimes. ",33.0
928," 13th june 2000 Dear Ms Ryam, I was very happy to receive your letter since I was eager to spend some time in the USA. I would like to reach the camp in july, and spend there the last two weeks of the month because in August I must start studying for my examinations. As to accomodation I would like to choose a tent because I am used to travelling with my sleeping bag and my tent all over Europe. As far as activities are concerned I would prefer Basketball and Climbing. I am very good at basketball, and even if I am not a tall boy, I am a good playmaker and I play in a local team. As to climbing I am almost inexperienced but I would like to improve. I would like to ask you  some other things. Which kind of clothes have I to put in my case? I would like to know, for instance, whether the evenings there are cold or hot. Please let me know if the Camp California accepts credit cards I look forward to hearing from you Yours sincerely Fabienne Mull  [SEP]  13th June 2000 Dear Kim, I was very happy to receive your last letter. As you know I had a great time helping at a PoP Concert. I was at the concert when I met a friend of mine whose job is to organise shows like that. He told me He needed a boy who could help on stage. As you known I can do a little of everything so I accepted. I connected wires, I caried loudspeakers, and so on. When the show started I was on the stage close to  famous singers, Bono Vox and David Bowie. Towards the end of the concert I hansled a bottle of wine to Poolo Conte. I couldn't believe in it! Poolo Conte asked me to drink with Him. As you know He's my favorite singer. We started talking about music and I asked Him many things about His texts, which are beautiful but sometimes difficult to understand. I think I won't never forget that evening. I'm looking forward to hearing from you. With my best wishes Fabienne ",34.0
774," Dear Mrs. Ryan, First of all, I would like to thank you for the letter which brought me such good news. I enjoyed a lot participating in your competition and hope to apreciate the travel I won. Secondly, I will give you with pleasure some information about myself you need to have. To be honest, the only suitable time for me to travel is in July because my session at the University will have finished only in the end of June. As an accommodation at Camp California I prefer a tent because I have been doing camping for years and enjoy it very much. As I have a chance to do 2 activities while I am at the Camp, I will choose singing which I am very good at and swimming which I am fond of but unfortunately, not a professional. In the end I would like you to tell me if I should take some special clothes and also the sum of money I will need... during my vacation. I wish you all the best and look forward to hearing from you soon. Sincerely yours, Lena Kazanova  [SEP]  A lot of women would never agree with me and almost all the men of the world would never believe that in my opinion, shopping is really not always enjoyable. Eternal crowds, high prices, long hours of choosing a suitable thing, that is what shopping means to me. Especially, I can't support to do shopping with my mother: it takes so much time that later I regret of agreeing to go with . When I am on my own, everything is fine: I do my shopping quickly because I never have to spend hours to choose what I really want either for myself or someone else. Shopping is a personal art and everybody has his own way  to do it. Some go just to kill the time others - to look at something new, I am in the third group - previously I think of what I will buy and go straight to the department I need. But sometimes I have to forget my opinion and spend all the day looking for my mother in a huge department-store. ",32.0
532," Dear Mr Brown, I went to the Circle Theatre yesterday, to see the play ""Over The Rainbow"" and I must say that I got rather disappointed. First of all, the play was supposed to start at 7:30 P.M. but it actually started only at 8:15 P.M. so I had to wait forty-five minutes. Also, your advertisement sign says that discounts are available. What is quite not true because when I asked for it, the woman who sells the tickets replied with a resounding ""no"". When the play finally started, and the two actors entered the stage, I could see that the male one was not Danny Brook, differently from what the advertisement sign says, what really disappointed me since he was the only reason that I came to this play. But my complaints are not over yet. After the disappointing performance  the actor who replaced Danny Brook, I went to the theatre restaurant, and, also differing from the advertisement sign, it was closed. There was only a small sign stamped on the door, saying that it was ""closed for repairs"". So, unfortunately, I must say that last night was one of the worst nights I ever had, and  given the reasons, I expect   to count with your sense of responsability, so, I feel that I must ask for my 20 pounds  spent on that terrible night. yours faithful,  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed your daily life? As we all know, technology had a gigantic improvement over the last 20 years, and today, it affects us in many ways. First of all, we all became much more sedentary than in the past. Most of the modern jobs involves computers, so there is no physical effort, just mental, but, on the other hand, we improved communications with computers and  Internet, a kind of communication where there is no need to meet personally, to see the other person, just the need to talk. Also, with today's machines, factories have significantly increased their production, what brings progress to humanity, but also, with the continous replacement of men by machines, the unemployment is increasing too, and today, it worries every single citizen of the world, specially the ones who lives in third world country. So, men have invented machines to help him on his tasks, but nowadays, we our becoming slaves of them. The most important thing in the future will be knowing how to deal with machines, so, today's children must be introduced to computers since an early age, so that they could have a chance to compete with the furious emearrence in the future.

Thank you, Yours sincerely Elina  [SEP]  Shoping is not always enjoyable If you need something you have a choice  to borrow it from friends or  library, or to bye it. Let's speak about shoping. As in all there are some advantages and disadvantages. Do you think it's  enjoyable  spending of time? If you would ask me, I prefer my friends to do all  shoping for me. Because I  aware of  big lines to  check point, crowds of people, noise... And of'course not all shops have good conditionering. In my opinion the better time for shoping is weekdays, preferably in the morning. Otherwise, you either will not find what you are looking for, or you will, and spend the rest of the day in  bad mood, because of  bad maners of sales people, that not every time you ask can give you any advice. It can be boring, it can be not. Summerise all, I will recomend to spend less time indoors, shopping during the weakdays. ",21.0
1155," Dear Mrs Maria Smith Thank you for your letter. It's a shame that I won't see Richard because of his illness, but I'm willing to help you as much as I can. Then I will give you some information which you asked for in your letter. Firstly, about your accomodation, our college which I belong to offers visitor free accomodations with full of facilities. (for example bath, car park, free internet access, etc.) They also are located in our campus so you can get to the conference by walk. Secondly, as you know we'll have a party after the conference, which will be taken place at our student council hall with some meals. This party is unlikely to be that formal, but I recommend you not to wear jeans and trainners. At last, if you have  free time for  couple of ours, you'd better visit Kamakura City, which is 30 minutes from our campus by train. That is  very traditional Japanese city where so many temple and heritages are there. I'm sure you'll enjoy it and maybe get familier with our culture. By the way, if you have any other questions, please send me a letter again.  [SEP]  Oh Baby, I can't live without you! These days, we've been sorrounded with so any different kinds of products which our ancestors invented. In our daily life, however, we seldom notice how much convinient  life we've got , what is more, how much inconvinient our grandparents had got. How nasty we are! Let us try to appreciate thier importance again. As for me, the invention which is most important to me is a personal computer. I have been a full time student in the university at home, and their classes all requires us to have personal computer and use them at any times. When you take the class on computer programming, you will definetly need one and it holds true for the class on politics, because you have to study statistic on your computer for doing social research and some analysys. My professor said 'go and get familier with your computer, otherwise you'll fail'. I find it amazingly easy to forget the importance of inventions which we useually use without any questione. That's the nature of human being. But, I think it's not only our fault but the evidence of how much they integrate  in our life. ",22.00
537," Dear Mr./Mrs: I have just received your letter in which you inform  that I won  first prize of two weeks at Camp California. I am very excited about it! I would like to travel on July, since I am studying and that is the only month I have for vacation. Fortunately, I have heard that  weather is beautiful in California during that month. I'd rather sleep in  tents because I want to enjoy this wild experience! I will take my sleeping bag with me, just in case. I would love to participate in the singing and photography activities. Singing is something I have enjoyed since I was a little child. In fact, I took some singing lessons. I am not very good at photography but I want to make an album to share it with my family when I come home. Could you please tell me what kind of clothes do you recommend for the camping? How much money will I need? Is it better to take cash or a credit card? Thanks for your attention. Cordially yours,  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable The best way to go shopping is when you think in advance  what you really want to buy and you know how much money you estimate to spend. If people would think about it BEFORE going shopping, they would not have a headache when they go home and realize they did not want what they bought. Shopping can be an awful adventure when people want to buy all their presents the day before Christmas, for example. There is no way to find good prices! Shops are crowded, items are of bad quality and people are buying without thinking. The worst time to go shopping is when people feel under stress or when they feel unsatisfied in their personal lives. It may seem relaxing at the beginning, but if they take their credit cards with them, the stress will increase when they have to pay for the bills!! Recommendations? Wait for a sunny day, take a look into your wardrobe, some money, ask a friend to go with you, and enjoy an exciting shopping ! ",33.0
53," Dear Mr/Mrs, I've seen your festival and I would like to give you my suggestions to it. I must say that  International Arts Festival is really  great idea. And your last festival was very intresting too. But also there are some notes that you should improve in the next year's festival to make it absolutelly wonderful. First of all, you must invite artists and stars from more countries around the world, because there are people only from six countries. I think it can make your festival more popular. Jazz, rock and classical concerts are amazing, but I think that some concert halls are too small, so not everybody can come. Your dance shows are very beautiful,  art exhibitions is something original and exciting. And also it is very interesting to talk with writers. I think that one reasonably-priced weekend  for all events is  exellent idea because it isn't so Expensive as buying  ticket to each event, and with this ticket you can visit everything you want. I hope you will continue to making your festivals. Your faithfully,  [SEP]  Dear Tom, How are you? Thank you for your last letter. It was very interesting. The question you asked me in it is very original too. I must say that  rules aren't  same in  schools of our country. Every school has it's own rules. I think that my school is very democratic and so there are very good relations between teachers and students. We are all very friendly in our class and we help to each other when we have a problem. So the main rule in our school is regarding theachers. I'm allowed to do many things at home. My parents are very kind, and they know that their son will do everything right. And the main reason Why our family is so friendly, it's because we haven't go many rules. So, I think there isn't something I'd like to change. I hope everything is good in your family and your school. Take care, ",23.00

As I have already planned my holiday for August, I will only be available in July, after my exams. It would be nice to have a tent because I have never been camping and would like to try it, at least once. The list of activities that you have is very interesting so my choice was very difficult to make but I have finally decided to chose sailing because I have been sailing for five years now and enjoy it very much. My second choice is climbing because I have never climbed and would like to have a go at it. I do not have any idea of what the weather is like and what kind of clothes I should take. Also, I would like to know if it is better to exchange my money in England or in the USA. I hope you will be able to answer these questions. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Like most of the girls I enjoy shopping but it can be either a great moment or a nightmare. What you expect when you go shopping, generally with a friend or two, is wandering around and looking at everything. Having money and be able to spend it in anything you want is brilliant therefore you try to turn it in an enjoyable moment. The nightmare starts when you find out that the items you like the most are also the most expensive. Then, you decide to wait for the savings but it is even worse as everybody want to do their shopping at that time and the streets are so crowded you cannot even look for your favourite items. You are hot in the shops, feel annoyed and most of the time cannot find anything you wanted. To conclude, I would say that to have a nice moment shopping you had better to save a lot of money and buy something as soon as you see it or be very patient. ",35.0
947," Dear Mrs Ryan, I received your letter last week and I would like to thank you very much. I was really surprised and happy to hear that I won the first prize On your letter you ask me some questions about my wishes: First of all, I would prefer travelling during the month of July, because I have already booked a holiday with my cousins in August. Secondly, I would prefer sleeping in a tent because I am  very active person who loves the outdoor life. Thirdly, I am keen on sailing and I have been lucky enough to practice this sport, moreover, I passed my licence last year in Port Camargue in France so it means that I can teach this sport. I also choose the Golf I have never played this sport but I am sure I will enjoy it. Would you be kind enough to tell  if I need  special clothes or equipment? Furthermore could you give me an idea about the pocket money I need? Please do not hesitate to contact me if you need more information about me. Looking forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely, Brigitte Bourgeois  [SEP]  From: Brigitte Bourgeois To: Mrs Darley - teacher Subject: short video about daily life at our school. The purpose of this report is to identify which lessons or other activities should be filmed. In order, to prepare this report I visited in many occasions the classrooms and talked to the students and teachers. It seems to me that it will be a nice idea to show our library because according to the librarians, the library has a welcoming atmosphere and is also well-used, moreover the range of books and newspapers is very large and useful. The students mentionned that it would be very interessting to show the English course because some foreign students will probably join our college next year and it is the best way for them to discover  our English course. To sum up, I would suggest to film our library because it is a pleasant place that students really like and the English course which will help foreign students for their future choice. ",36.0
231," DEAR ""CIRCLE THEATRE"" MANAGER, I AM WRITING IN ORDER TO EXPRIME MY DISAPPOINTMENT AT THE SHOW ""OVER THE RAINBOW"" PERFORMED 2 WEEKS AGO; FIRST OF ALL, I READ ON THE ADVERTISEMENT THAT DANNY BROOK WAS TO ACT IN THE SHOW, BUT THE ACTOR THAT REALLY PLAYED WAS  DIFFERENT  , AND THIS WAS VERY DISAPPOINTING. THEN, THE SHOW WAS TO BEGIN AT 19:30, BUT IT BEGAN ONLY AT 20.15! AS REGARDS THE TICKETS, I READ THAT DISCOUNTS WERE AVAILABLE, BUT IT WAS NOT SO, AND I HAD TO PAY THE WHOLE PRICE. MOREOVER, AFTER THE SHOW, I HAD INTENTION TO VISIT YOUR THEATRE RESTAURANT, BUT IT WAS CLOSED AND THERE WAS NO EXPLANATION FOR THAT. EVENTUALLY, YOU PROMISED ON YOUR ADVERTISEMENT A PERFECT EVENING OUT; AS IT HAD NOT BEEN SO, I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE MY MONEY BACK. I HOPE TO HEAR FROM YOU SOON, BEST WISHES  [SEP]  FASHION: THIS TERM EVOKES TOP MODELS, STYLISTS, COLOURS AND THE GREAT EUROPEAN CAPITAL CITIES, LIKE ROME, LONDON AND PARIS. BUT IT IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO DEFINE IT OR TO FIX THE RULES WITHIN WHICH IT DEVELOPES; NOWADAYS THE FASHION WORLD INCLUDES (AND IS CREATED BY) STYLISTS FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD, EACH ONE PRESENTING A DIFFERENT MODEL OF BEAUTY, SOMETIMES ONE  OPPOSITE FROM ANOTHER. I THINK THAT FASHION IN THE FUTURE WILL DEVELOPE ACCORDING TO VERY DIFFERENT LINES: THERE MAY BE A RETURN TO THE FASHION OF THE PAST, AS WE CAN NOTICE YET NOW, OR A MORE FANTASCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPEMENT. SURELY, ORDINARY PEOPLE WILL NOT FOLLOW ONLY THE MODELS PRESENTED ON TV, AS REGARDS EVERYDAY LIFE, I THINK THAT IN THE FUTURE ATTENTION WILL BE FOCALIZED ON COMFORTABILITY MORE THAN ON ELEGANCE. BUT IF IT IS DIFFICULT TO FORECAST THE DEVELOPEMENTS OF THE FASHION WORLD, IT IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO FORECAST THOSE OF THE COMMON PEOPLE, THAT IS A TOO VARIOUS  CATHEGORY. ",31.0
1159," Dear Mrs. Smith, Thank you for your letter. I am very pleased to give you the information you requested. We are holding the conference party at the Royal Lancaster Hotel - banqueting room at 2.00 pm on Sat. 24 June. The nearest tube station is Lancaster Gate. As you know, we've been working very hard all this term. So we've decided at the end-of-conference party, we will have a buffet and a disco party. Our students, then will get to know each other well. I would suggest everybody to wear a casual dresses. Finally, I would recommend you and your group to enjoy shopping and sightseeing around Oxford Street and nearby. I look forward to see you and your group soon. Your Sincerely,  [SEP]  To: The group leader From: Re: The Barbican Centre. As you requested which is the interesting building to visit. I would strongly recommend the Barbican Centre building in the city. It located in the city and the nearest tube station is Moorgate Station. The Barbican Centre built in 1975. Apart from Banks and important offices. There are also  world stock market exchange, an opera theatre, shopping arcades,  books and records stores. It also held an internation exhibition all year round. Recently, the exhibition of africa just finished. The opening time starts from 7.30 AM. till late at night when the theatre is closed.

You and your group will visit one building which has so many places in this building. So that you can spend your time in one go. ",25.00
78," Dear Ms Jane Clark. I am writing to you with regard to the International Art Festival that was held recently. The festival was excenent in many ways, and especially it being an international festival was a challenging, but brilliant idea. I assume that this fact attracted people very much. In addition to that, organising one weekend with special price tickets was particularly good. I personally think that it helped many people who were not able to afford the tickets with  proper price to come to the festival. Moreover, most of the events I went to were fantastic. However, I still have some comments to make to improve the festival next year. The festival was supposed to be an international one, but the artists and stars   participated in it were from six countries only. Thus, I recommend that stars and artists of various nationalities should be invited. Also, some of the concert halls where the musicians performed were not big enough for the vast number of audiences. I think it would be much better to use bigger concert halls. Furthermore, I found that there were not many genres of neither the films nor the plays. So I suggest you have various kinds, and more numbers of plays and films next year. I hope that next year's festival will be much more successful that this year's one. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  The Old Man and the Sea People all have different opinions about books. Some prefer realistic stories whereas others do unusual ones. But I prefer realistic stories such as Ernest Hemingway's ""The Old Man and the Sea'. Above all, realistic stories teach me something of the life, or at least influence me. As far as I'm concerned, my behaviour and attitudes towards a difficult situation began to change after reading this book. Here, the fishman is very old, but he is still challenging to everything he faces. When he caught a shark which was bigger than the ship, he never gave up  taking it back to his village, even when sharks were around him. Real stories have huge impacts on me, and affect me a lot, often in good ways. In addition to that, realistic stories are more attractive, I personally don't want to hear stories about very peculiar incidents as I know they cannot be true. But, while reading realistic stories, I just fall deep into the story, into the writer's own world. Ernest Hemingway's sentences are precise, but still very powerful and alive. So when I read  other sharks eating the shark the old man had caught, I got very angry and annoyed. Realistic stories thus, develop our imagination and creativity, which are essential in our lives. We all learn from reading books, but realistic stories have more influence on me and develop my personality. That's why I prefer realistic stories to unusual ones. ",34.00
1035," Dear Mr Robertson, Many thanks for the programme you have organised. It is really interesting and diversity at the same time. There is just one thing I want to tell you; Janine and Richey have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure show and we all would like to go to the show. That is in the central Exhibition Hall, near the hotel, and it is only about fashion:  latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles. I think it could be very interesting and it is free for students (what is really good). It is a great opportunity because this show is only each two years and normaly it is difficult to go in. And, as you know we all are interested in fashion. In my opinion, I would suggest to go to the show instead of the National Art Gallery because we could go there another time. Or, going to the show on wensday morning and on the afternoon, we can choose between free time or  National Art Gallery. I look farward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. I went out of the room, ran as much as I could and started thinking  what this man was doing here and who he was. When I arrived in the street it was dark,  windy, but I could see a shadow at the corner of the opposite street. By the time I arrived here, he has disappeared. Suddenly, I felt very tired and decided to go home. My sister was standing, crying and showing the front door. I took her in my arms and opened the door: my mother was sitting in a chair, reading a book, with blood all around her. I finally realized that she was dead. The police arrived twenty minutes later, took my mother and checked to see what could be interesting to find the murder: lucky, the knife which he used to kill her was still here and in fact they could arrested him. They found hime two months after and six months after he was in jail. To forget everything, I moved to Irkind with my sister in a small house in the countryside. Everything was going on, when one day, I came in the house and found my mother sitting in a chair reading a book, with blood all around her. ",25.00
365," Dear Sir or Madam, Last week I spent my holiday in London and I've seen your musical ""Over the rainbow' in the Circle Theatre and I was really disappointed. When I read the advertisment for the show I was really excited but after the show I was not very happy because of the following problems. The advertisment says that Danny Brook and Tina Truelove would play but in this show there were totally different actors and that was really disappointing because I was looking forward to them. The times were also not alright, actually the show starts at 19.30 but in this evening it started at 20.15. The advertisment also says that there are discounts available but this is not true, there were none. Usually I go to a restaurant after theatre but this was also not possible because your theatre restaurant was closed because of  holiday. Why do you give those information in an advertisment. For me it was really not a perfect evening, I was expecting a nice evening but in fact it was terrible. Because of these problems I had I would like to ask for a compensation, maybe to get my money back. I hope you understand my complains. I wish you answer me soon. Yours sincerely Sandra Eichmann  [SEP]  In my opinion the modern technology has changed my daily life not really a lot because I am just 20 years old and I used to play   computer when I was young or wash my clothes in the washing machine. I grew up in a world with full of technology and for me the  development in the technology is not very big. Of course, it changes, it became normal to have a mobile phone or to use mainly the computer and the internet. It becomes more and more easier to use the computer for everything. You don't have to go to the shop to buy clothes or to the restaurant to order some food. I can just switch on my computer and order everything. I also don't write letters anymore because I write e-mails to my friends. That goes quicker and it is easier for me. But I think in my generation it is not a really big difference. In comparison to my grandparents they have really problems to accept these changes in modern technology. Because the biggest developments were in the last 50 years. ",30.0
385," Dear Sir/Madam; I am writing to complain about the musical show ""Over The Rainbow"", which as organised in your theatre. Firstly, I had been looking forward to that show since Danny Brook was to be one of the main actors; however, there was other actor instead of him, which came to me as a great disappointment. Secondly, as for the times , instead of 19.30 it all started at 20:15, which involved being stranded in the theatre for such a long time. Added to this, I had brought very little money in the hope that I would get a discount. Nevertheless, there was not any available. Finally, as regards the theatre restaurant, it was closed due to problems with the pipes. As you may realize, it was not a perfect evening out but a complete disaster. I am asking you  a full refund or at least part of my money back. I look forward to hearing from you, Yours faithfully ANDREHI LISA DANZELLI  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. What is more, every time I trusted her with my secrets, she always let me down. It was always the same; she would meet with her neighbours afterwards and give my secrets away. To make matters worse, people gossiped about me and tried to find out more and more about my private affairs, which made me feel embarrassed. The worst point was that she started to make up false stories about me, which soon spread all around the neighbourhood. Needless to say, I couldn't put up with that situation any longer so I determined to fall out with her. Since then, I hasen't talked to her again, despite the fact that she regretted doing all that and really wanted to make up with me. Of course, I became aware of her feelings since a friend of mine overheard a conversation between Pat and other girl. In spite of that, I found it difficult to forgive her as she had hurt my feelings; that's why the only thing I could tell her since we had quarrelled was: ""It serves you right, I'll hate you for the rest of your life!"" ",36.0
514," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing with reference to a musical show I saw recently in your theatre. The advertisement promised there would be my favorite star Danny Brook, but there was an other actor who could not play his part as well as Danny Brook In addition, the performance started 45 minutes later, so we couldn't visit your theatre restaurant after the show because it had been closed already. More over, when I was buying our tickets, there weren't any discounts in spite of the fact that my wife and me are both on  pension. As a result our evening was completely spoiled. So I am sure you will understand why I  so annoyed and frustrated with the whole incindent. I look forward to hearing from you in the very near future to offer me a partly refund. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Two days ago her best friend Maria told her that her parents were going to devorce, Maria was so upset that she couldn't keep it  herself. Her father had met another woman who had not been as pretty as Maria's mother but worked in a bank and had a good salary. One day Maria and her mother returned home and found a letter. All  fathers things were missing. They could not believ their eyes. They read the letter and slowly went onto the kitchen. Maria bought his favorite food and she throw it away into the bin. How he could have done it to them? They had been so happy for 15 years. They had gone everywhere together and laughed a lot. Now everything was over. She went to skool, but she could not pick the material up as easy as she used to. So she decided to tell Pat, her lovely Pat. She was so understanding. Now everyone knows about her sad story  that makes her feel even more worse. ",30.0
84," Dear Mrs. Clark, The International Arts Festival was very interesting including the fact that Stars and artists had also come from around the world.   I enjoyed it tremendously.  Later I found out that the stars and artists had only come from six countries. Not only were there Jazz and Rock but there were clasics as well.  The only thing that distracted me was the size of the concert halls.   They were very small and I was pushed by everyone. There were wonderful plays and films which I hope that there would have been more .  All the other shows such as dance shows, art exhibition and talks by writers were very amusing. I was happy at the end as the weekend tickets were reasonably-priced for all events.  I thought it was worthwhile to have spent two days in the Arts Festival at the end. Yours Sincerely  [SEP]  Once upon a time there was a widow and a widower.  They treated each other as if they were husband and wife. Around two years later there was a meeting.  By that time the widow could not walk and the widower could not see.  When the widower sensed that the widow badly wanted to go, the widow clung on the widower's back and set off telling him where to go. On the way they were thirsty so when they looked into the lake, they saw a long bar of gold.  The widower told the widow leave it alone as they couldn't share it when the widow told him.  They kept going on until they met a fat, small man.  He came and said to the widower that he was to bring him on his back.  The widow who was afaid told the man of the gold. When the man hurriedly ran to the lake, all he found was a long snake.  He was just able to kill it by cutting the snake into half by using his knife which was as sharp as a sickle. The man went back to the widower and kicked him.  The widower was confused and they went to the lake.  They were very surprised when they found out the gold was cut in half.  They lived happily ever after.   This story happened a long time ago. ",32.00
1122," Dear Mr Robertson, We would like to thank you for all the time you have spend for us in order to organize the programme that we should follow during  three days that we are going to spending  London. We all believe that  is a great programme which concludes both education and free time. We would like to inform you that we notice an advertisement for the London fashion and Leisure Show. This show is going to take place in the Central Exhibition Hall of London on Tuesday, March 14 between the hours 10.00-19.00, and we would like to ask you if it is possible to go to that show. We think that  is a great opportunity and we are all very interesting  to go because we can see there the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, lot  kinds of make up and some of the famous hairstylers. The show is absolutly free for students. As a class we suggest to go to this show on Tuesday, March 14  morning and to visit the Science Museum on Wednesday afternoon during our free time. If that of course is possible. We  all like to thank you again.  [SEP]  In the year 2000  media is one of the most powerful things on the planet. The media is everywhere, televisions, radio stations, newspapers,  magazines all have one goal, to inform the citizens. Some of them, however are not doing their job probably. They don't inform people about news, education or documentaries. They just published gossips about famous people, such as politicians, musicians and film stars. I believe all the people famous or not, deserve to have  private life without journalists to following them all the time. They are humans like all of us with their problems, their good and bad times and of course they don't want to be publish them in front of millions of people because a journalist thought that this is right. And good for his pocket. I think the only way of change that is, the people, If the people shows no interest  the journalist would have no goal of publish any gossips because  is not going to be watch or read by anyone. So the power is to the people. ",29.00
416," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing in order to explain to you the problems regarding the musical show I saw at your theatre. First of all, there was written in the advertisement for the show, that there would be Danny Brook as main actor, but a different actor played in the show. The show started forty-five minutes later and this really disappointed me. Besides, when I bought the ticket, I found out there was not  discounts for ticket, while you wrote the contrary. Moreover, I could not go to the theatre restaurant because, by the time the show had finished, it had already closed. Definetely, it was a very disappointing evening and I would appreciate your if it was possible to have my money back. I am looking forward to hearing from you in the near future. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. She was a very pretty and kind girl, but she had this bad habit. This was her only fault. She had a lot of friends but nobody trusted her. That was why she decide to change her behaviour. She was given a chance: if she had been able not to tell everybody a secret for a short time, her friends would have started trusting her. The secret was about a surprise-party for her bestfriend's birthday. As soon as the arrangement for the party started, she began to feel nervous and anxious because she wanted to tell everything to her bestfriend. But, as the days went by, she was surprised because she realized she was getting used not to tell secrets any more. The day of the party arrived and Pat succeeded in keeping the secret. All her friends were amazed at  her change and started trusting her at once. ",31.0
1088,"  Dear Mr Robertson, I am writing you this letter to complain about  you have organized  us for our trip to London. First of all, I would like to thank you for your activity programme. I find it really good, specially because of the visit to the Science Museum and the National Art Gallery. But I would like you to know that on Tuesday March 14th in London, there is a show, which is free for students, about the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles called The London Fashion and Leisure Show. All the clan would enjoy going  the show, because it is a great oportunity to see an exhibition as the latest fashions. We know that you have planned a very complete programme. But we would like to suggest you to move our visit to the Science Museum to Wednesday afternoon, so that, we can go to the show on Tuesday, which lasts from 10 am to 7 pm. Thank you very much for considering our petition. I look forward receiving your reply. Yours sincerely  [SEP]   Nowadays, in our society, there are some people who, because of their work or because of their success in life, has become popular, and by now is known by everybody. But, how does fame affect to their lifestyle? Politicians, musicians or film starts are controlled all the time, since  they wake up in the morning until they go to bed in the evening, by journalists and photographers who follow them and observe all that they do. It is certain that these people have fame, fortune and success, and that many of them are rich, very rich. They usually appear on TV,  go to shows,  sports competitions... But I'm sure that all these things can not give them back one of the most needed things: a private life. And believe me, there is no money in the world  to pay that. But obviously, if these people are all the time in the newspaper, on TV and so on,  is because, although we don't want to accept it, we love following their lifes. So now, all we should have to ask ourselves is if their damaged lifestyles is in part our fault. ",31.00
644," Dear Helen Ryan I am replying in response of the competition I won. As you asked in the letter, I will write everything I need to know about the travel. First of all, I would like to travel on July, because during the other months, I will be studying, preparing myself for other exams or I will be out travelling somewhere else with my relatives. I have been thinking and I decided I would prefer to stay in  tents, simply because it's a new experience and I would like to try everything new. Also, it seems more dangerous. For the two activities I have to choose, I decided to choose a new activitie that I have never done before, which is Sailing, so I am a totally begginer at this. The other activitie is Photography, I am not an expert, but I know how to use a camera, all I want is to improve my knowledge. Finally, I need to know what kind of clothes and how many  I should pack. Is there any place that I can wash my clothes? I also needed some information on the money I will take. Do you have any kind of souvenirs that I can buy? Do I need to take any money at all? I will be waiting  a reply. Your sincerely, Sara Todi  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I'm sorry it took so long for me to answer your letter, but I've been too busy with my school, papers and everything. But now I found some time to tell you everything about the pop concert I helped . There were about a hundred people that wanted to help, but only two would be chosen. When they said my name, I couldn't believe it! All I could think was ""Oh my god, I'm gonna be talking  and helping the most famous pop bands!"" I was so excited that I couldn't believe . When I arrived to help them, they welcomed me and were so nice with me that it seemed we had known each others in ages! They weren't those kind of people that think they're gods. I helped them  organizing the stage, cleaning everything, fixing what was broken and they even let me play with their guittars! That was so great! I don't know exactly how I felt, sometimes I wake up and think it was nothing but a dream. I hope you liked everything I said and I hope an answer as soon as possible. Best wishes, Sara ",33.0
667," Dear the competition organiser (Helen Ryan) I'm as happy to heard that I have won the first prize. Here is the information you want from me.  Firstly, I can only go in July. Because I'm in the holiday  that moment. I think I would prefer the accommodation at Camp California is in tents. Because it is more safety, and I don't like to be in the log cabins. The activities are quite hard to choose really, because you have a lot of chose which is I like. But I think I will choose Basketball and Photography, because basketball is the only sport I can play well. Photography is a very interesting activitie, and is not too hard to do too. Here  have some questions which I would like to ask, what kind of clothes sould I need? How much did I need for the Camp? Finally I hope the information I've gave are useful for you, and hope you can answers my questions A.S.A.P. Yours Sincerely  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable  Shopping, for most the people it is very important because you need to get the stuff you need or you want. For some people it may be a method to relax themselves, after you have been to work or school. So it is a thing you will enjoy most of the time, but still have something you will not enjoy it. It depends on what is the place and the aim you are shopping. For example some people always shopping to get food or stuff the need in everyday life, they won't enjoy this kind of shopping, because it is not getting what they want. The place where you are shopping  also very important. For example in HK all the areas have lots of people it won't let you feel good of the noise and times when you are shopping. Because have too many people it make you want to stay home  won't enjoy shopping. After I've written this composition, I think that you will enjoy shopping most of the time, but still have sometimes you won't. ",24.0

Now, I would like to reply  some questions you need, willingly. At first, I would like to travel only in July because I study at University at the moment. However, they will give me such a long holiday enough to travel for two weeks in June. I would prefer staying  tents to log cabins, as I'd like to observe nature and stay in outdoor as much time as I can. I'm very happy with the activities you organised. I am good at playing basketball, swimming, tennis, surfing as they are my hobbies for donkey's years. I would rather play golf and go sailing, than the others so as to find new hobbies in my life. Finally, what I would like to ask is what sort of cloths are suitable for the travelling, and also, how much money I should prepare for the travelling, approximately. I would be grateful if you could reply  my letter with some further information soon. Yours sincerely Takashi Oshima.  [SEP]  Dear Kim, How are you going these days? I'm fine as usual. Anyway, I joined the team which helps anything at a pop concert last month as you know. In my view, it was extremely interesting and satisfing for me all the concert long. Talking of my work, I had to mostly make the concert stage with some fellows. If you choose the post, you would be exhausted throughlly in the end of the concert. However, there was a particular thing I really liked during the concert. As I could take a rest beside the concert stage while someone was singing a song, I saw a number of famous musicians nearby. Although I can not explain any more about the thing I felt during the concert in this letter, I'd like to recomend you to help at a pop concert or the other. It must be a good experience and a special memory for you. See you and write  me soon. Best Wishes ",23.0

Also, in Augost I will be studying a summer English course. In addition, I would prefer to stay in a tent. Because I would like to stay somewhere which differs from my home and every days comforts, in these two weeks. However, in your letter  is written some activities.

I was going to markets  to schools and I was giving  information  when and where the group was going to appear as well as where can they buy or book a ticket for this concert. I know, It was difficult and tired but I enjoyed  a lot. Firstly, it was a good break from the  routine. Because I did it for  first time. Also, I felt wonderful when I saw, that the concert had  succesed and every day  was croweded. Because I believed that this was a result which came  with my help.

I would like to travel at the beginning of the month,  could be between  first and  fifteeth of july, because afterwards I have several business meetings and it would be difficult for me to take a trip. Related with accommodation, I'd prefer to stay in  log cabins.

Really, this prize is wonderful to have a healthy life. I want to do two activities; painting and tennis. The first one is for my mental health, I need a break in my style of life. the second one is just because I'm  fanatic of that sports (really I'm not martine hingis). Eventually, I'd like to request to have  special food, because and vegetarian person, besides I try to eat just organic food. I hope my reply has been suitable. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Kim, How are you doing? It have been a long time since the last time I wrote  you... I'm sorry. However the reason is absolutely amazing. I was training to be a personal assistance to Madonna herself. Maybe, you don't believe me, but it's true. I applied to the job and she selected me between hundreds of candidates (I don't receive  salary). My work is to help her during each concert. You know, she has a brilliant performance where she must change her customs, make up,  scenery, everytime; so she needs a lot of people near. My first job was in the Hillsborough's concert ( I think, you heard about it). I was running all the show, my responsability was to get dress her. I wasn't alone, I worked with a staff of ten people. We had to take of some clothes   and then to put on others ones completly different, in just  few minutes (similar to Formula One). I was exhausted when the concert finished, anyway it has been one of my best experience and I'll remember  for life. Finally, I send you all my positive energy and I am looking forward to receiving your letter back. all the best. ",26.0
218," Dear Sir/Madam, Further to the umpleasent fact that took place last week I am in my right of complaining about the musical show I saw when I was in London. First of all, when we arrived we went to pay and we gave  a discount ticket. It was not available but the worst thing was that nobody explained us the reason. The show had to start at 19:30 and it did not start until 8:15, then I felt dissappointed because the main actor had been changed. It  had not been such a terrible thing if the new actor would have acted as well as the other one. If it does not seem enough, after the show by boyfriend wanted to invite me to eat something in the theatre's restaurant but the umpleasent surprise was that it was closed because all the waiters were on holiday. After explaining you my complains I hope you to send me some money back. I am looking forward to hearing from you soon. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. It was our last school year, so we decided to organize a trip to celebrate  we had finally finished it. We knew that our parents wouldn't let us to travel alone so we had to invent a story to avoid they could realize what happened. Kim, Kate and Pat told their parents they were going to travel with the school and so, did I. We were excited and we started to organized everything. We booked some rooms in a hotel, next to the beach and we bought all the useful things we were going to need. It seemed  the perfect holiday but it wasn't. Pat was in love with my eldest brother whose name is Jon (I have never got on well with him). Pat told him our idea. Pour Pat, she didn't know my brother, she didn't know how he was. Jon told my parents what we wanted to do. We lost our holidays. ",24.0
275," 17th June 2000 Dear Sir, Last week, I was on holiday in London, and reading the advertisement for your musical show, I had planned (like it is said) ""a perfect evening out"". But  it turned out, it really wasn't a pleasant evening, and I didn't enjoy myself. On top of this, the advertisement wasn't correct at all, or I must have been to the wrong show! According to the advertisement, the show should have started at 19.30, but it didn't begin before 20.15. That's nearly an hour later! The tickets were rather expensive, and the discounts mentionned in the advertisement weren't at all available at the theatre. They had never heard of such a thing! The actors were not the ones expected: there was no sign of Danny Brook, and the person who played his part was very disappointing. I was a little hungry after the show, but then again, I had to find another restaurant since the theatre restaurant was closed with no further information . In conclusion, I wasn't at all satisfied, and I would like my money back since the show wasn't worth it. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.. But I found out afterwards and it was too late. Pat was my friend, I trusted her and we got on very well untill she had repeated to everyone the secret I had told her. There was only one thing I didn't like with her: she could do anything to have friends, even betray me. No one knew apart from me and my mother. I kept lying when somebody asked where my dad was. ""He's travelling around the world"" I would say, and everyone would admire him. But  know Pat knew, and because of her, so did everyone else: he was in prison because he had killed a man. Since everyone knew the truth, things weren't the same. Everyone, even my friends, looked at me in a strange kind of way. As if I was guilty. What did I have to do with this? I wasn't the one who had killed the man, but it seemed people didn't want to talk to me anymore. I knew, now, why I wanted to hide the truth. ",32.0
871," Dear Madam I am very happy to win this prize and I am going to give you some information from me that you need to make me have a good time at Camp California. I would like to know only in July because I have set my holidays   this month since last January. I want if it is possible a log cabins like accommodation because I have been suffering from my back since my childhood, therefore I need a confortable accommodation. I will be pleased to swim and paint when I am at the camp. I selected swimming because it is a cure against my backace and I have not practiced  since I started my new job five years ago. I also choosed painting because I have never done  before, I would like to learn and moreover I want to do a calm activity. Otherwise, could you tell me approximately how much money I have to take for the food, please? Yours sincerely. Xavier Fournier  [SEP]  How many times have we heard people complaining about shopping? Sometimes, they are happy to do shopping. but why? Therefore, shopping can be enjoyable but it is not always the case. Shopping is enjoyable when you want to offer some thing to someone. In fact you try to get a present to make  receive happy. Shopping is also good, when you know what you want. For example if you want a new track suit you know that you have to go to a sport shop but if you don't know what you want you are going to waste your time in the shops. In the opposite, shopping can be disenjoyable. Shopping is boring if you go with people  too fussy. That is to say, they are never happy with what they get and see. They always find a problem. Shopping is not enjoyable with people who just look around the shops. It is stupid, they do not have any goal. They waste their time. To conclude, I agree with shopping is not always enjoyable. Even if I like to do shopping with some people and  kind of shops I will kill myself because I waste my time. ",26.0
988," Dear Madam: How delighted I was when I receved your letter! About the information required, I would like to go in July because  is my half term at University and summer time would be ideal. For accommodation I would rather go in a tent, I want to enjoy  wild life and admire the landscape. In relation with leisure activities, my favourites are Basketball, which I have been playing for two years because I have been selected for my University team and I think a time practising with players from different countries will help me develop my skills at  international level. Secondly, I would like to practise tennis, which is my hobby and I think it helps my mind to keep working. I would like to ask you how much money do I need, how is the weather in order to pack the necessary clothe and wheter I need something else. Yours sincerely.  [SEP]  Dear Kim: What a fantastic experience I had helping my favourite group! You wouldn't believe it! I was working helping to mantle and dismantle the stage, sometimes I had to check the sound by saying something on the microphone, that was my chance and I always pretended to be a singer and that I sand in  duo with the vocalist of the group, it was such a great fun! But the most exciting part of my job, and the one that I was looking forward to, was the last night of  concert, because all the staff were promised to have a party with all the members of the band. That night was the best of my entire life. I send you some pictures, the best ones  because there were some quite embarrasing . I hope you like them and I am already waiting for your next letter. Yours faithfully ",34.0
744,"  Misses Helen Ryan, First of all I would like to thank you for giving me the oportunity to travel. You asked me some questions about the day that suits me the best to depart, the accomodation I would like to have and so on. Travelling in July, I have to say, would be perfect for me because I have got my birtday the 24th of this month and I wish I could spend my birtday as well as possible, so it means there. I also would prefer to sleep into  tents which are more comfortable and, because I have been doing lots of campings, I am quite used to this kind of accomodation. The activities I have choosen both represent a pation for me. Painting and swimming are my way to spend a good time especially on holiday. I may have a question for you to answer, please could you tell my how much money do I need to bring with me? Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable. However it is not always enjoyable, people are shopping more and more, it is very fashionable those times. They do not always buy lots of things, but I think most of them do. Even people who haven't got lots of money go shopping anyway. Is it enjoyable to walk around shops, looking at nice stuff, without having enough money to spend on it? Is it enjoyable to go shopping when it is rush time or when it is very hot in summer for instance? Enjoying shopping isn't the reason for doing that. I think people either go shopping to change mind because they may have lots of problems or to meet other people, to feel they belong to a group of human being. ",25.0
483," Dear Sir, I am writing to complain about a musical show I saw at the Circle Theatre on Wednesday, June, 14th which was titled ""Over the Rainbow"". First of all, the advertisement I got layed emphasis on Danny Brook's starring , but eventually, a disappoint unknown actor played his part, and I wonder whether he had real skills to. To make matters worse, not only was the restaurant closed, without any appearant reason, but also the discounts that were said to be available were not. On top of everything, the performance began forty-five minutes late. I find it unbearable to witness such a lying advertising and to pay even ten pounds to spend such a disappointing evening. Consequently, I ask for  money back, and I will not obviously go back in the Circle Theatre. I join my receipt, and I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Over the last five years, she had caused many arguments because of unkept secrets, but she couldn't help speaking to everybody. This time, as Katie, her cousin, had told her their friend Bobby had stolen a great camera, but that this was confidential, Pat reacted violently; why was she told secrets she was unable to keep? However, she was interested in it, and decided to lead her own enquiry about this case. Bobby didn't use to commit such acts and the story looked very strange. Despite Katie's warning, Pat reached her purpose by questioning carefully her friends, and realized Bobby had been forced to rob this camera unless he wanted to be hurt. Pat knew there was no solving the problem without the adults' help. Katie and Bobby would be furious, but anyway... She  convicted the two criminals, and had the calm gone back within the school. It was the first time she had saved someone  telling a secret, and she realized she had made the good choice. ",26.0
1154," Dear Maria Smith, First of all, the group has been booked into the Palace Hotel. It is a big hotel because there will be a lot of people. It has a swimming-pool and a nice bar. The hotel is ten minutes far from the conference  and there will be a bus available to go directly over there. At the end of the conference, there will be a dinner in a luxurious restaurant so people must have nice clothes; jean's is not allowed. Next to the restaurant, there is a disco for people who like dancing. We can do a lot of things in my area. We have the possibility to visit the old town, it's very nice and there is a lot of shops. We can visit the old castle or the painting museum too.  [SEP]  I find television the most important invention. I think it's good for old people because some of them cannot go to the cinema anymore. In one hand it's because they have not enough money to pay  it and in the other hand it's because they can't move very well for example if they are disabled. With television, old people are less alone because most of old woman have not her husband anymore. Television is a good way to be informed with the news. I prefer being informed by television than by newspapers, it's more relaxing. I think television is a good invention for children  when they have free time and while they are watching television, we don't have to look after them if we have something important to do. ",26.00
975," 13.Jun. 2000 Dear Sir or Madam, I am very pleased to hear that I won the first prize in the competition. It would be great for me to go to the U.S.A as the prize and to stay for two weeks. Below is the information you requested  me. Firstly, I would like to travel in July because I have got a prior plan to teach the Korean children in Brighton about Korean and Korean history in the early August. Secondly, I would like to stay at log cabins which would have a good smell of nature in them. Also if I have to choose two of the activities, I would like to play tennis and to go surfing because playing tennis is my first choice and I am very good at it. And also the reason why I would like to go surfing is that I am always dreaming of surfing on the coast of California like on TV, but I have never tried to surf yet, which doen't mean I am bad at swimming. Finally, I would like you to let me know which clothes would be suitable for the weather at that time and how much money I should take. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours faithfully, Haneul Gay Kay.  [SEP]  When you spend money on goods and services, it gives you satisfaction and happiness but going shopping is not always enjoyable. There are a few reasons. Firstly, you cannot always get the right one although you scour about all the shops to find something you want. You may only get tired on your feet. And also you would have to thread your way between the shoppers because there are too many shoppers, especially, on the special occasion like on  sale. Secondly, you cannot exclude that you might get  a pick-pocket which would make you upset and irritated when you think of that you could avoid it and that you could take less money in your wallet from home. In addition to this, even if you buy something you would like, you can change your mind at home. Sometimes, a moment comes up that you would like to buy something you have not wanted because while you are shopping, you might get something beautiful or good to you. So you would spend more money  you have expected. To sum up, you should spend money as your plan and you should be cautious and sensible to make it enjoyable. ",30.0
63," 25th November 2000 Dear Mr Clark, I have seen your advertisement in ""the Sun"" newspaper on 10th November, and I went to the festival on last Friday. Most of the events were wonderful and well-organised. I enjoyed it, but I think it could be even better next year, so I would like to give my inmature views of it. Firstly, the idea of holding this International Arts Festival is great. I made people enjoyed their weekend, relaxed themselves,  also it brought the foreign culture to them, enlarged their kownlegth. In addition to it, one weekend ticket for all  events was only £10, this was excellent, it made people only spend pocket-money, and then they could watch all the events at the weeked, for them it is  really economical  to spent their weekend. So my friends told me that  was his cheapest weekend. Moreover, the stars and artists were only from six countries, In my opinion, if you can invite more stars and artists from more countries, it will make the festival more exciting, more intesting, and from my point of view, some  concert halls were too small, the people in there couldn't even go to the loo! because it was too crowed. Finally, the plays and films were wonderfully welcomed, as far as I'm concerned. If you can show more play and films It will achieve a good effect. This are only my inmature views, if it is considerable for you, I will be very pleased, thank you very much. I'm look forward to hearing your replies. yours sincerely,  [SEP]  16, Dec. 2000 Dear Yasmin, It was really pleased to receive your letter yesterday, you asked me about rules; both at my home and at my school, I am very happy to tell you about this. At my school, we aren't allowed to smoke inside the building, because the building is made of wood, it tend to catch fire easily, and we aren't allowed to use  Internet, there are only ten computers in the school, only teachers can use it, if we used , we would be sent to the head office of the school. At my home, there are many rules, because I'm careless, so I amn't allowed to smoke at home as well: and I'm not allowed to use  telephone, because last year I made  £1000 bill for one month, my parents were very angry with it, so they told me I am not to use  telephone any more, oh, How poor! How is the weather like in England, I hope it isn't too wet, please give my regards to your parents. Lots of love, ",26.00
1224," Dear Mrs Maria Smith. I was really pleased to receive at your letter. Unfortunately Richard Brown is ill but I can help you as much as I can. So, I'm writting to reply for giving all the information you asked for. Firstly, we've booked Palace Hotel, which is located in Central. The best way to get from the hotel to the conference its using  tube because it takes only 20 mininute. The tube is 2 line which is red colour. And your speach would be better for the end of conference party. I'd suggest you to wear at least, semi formal wears such as a jacket with another clothes. Finally, I give you some suggestions which could spend for about 3 hours in the national museum in my area. The museum can be helpful to understand our country's history and art. I look forward to seeing you soon. Yours sincerely,   [SEP]  Computer is the most important invention in our life. Some people might say the electricity  more important than  another thingh. It's hard to say which is the most important invention. However, I'd say  computer is  more amazing invention rather than another inventions such as the telephone, the car. Recently  computer is really necessary and we can't manage to work without them. Not only is for bussiness, but also in for my life. For instance, when I want to contanct with to my friend, it's quite helpful by using e-mail. Before  computer had been invented, we couldn't possibly have lots of information easily and we couldn't contact with to foreign countries at the same time. And also it's time to make new system which makes us use easier and more simple, so far more people can enjoy computer more than before. Despite  amazing invention, some times  computer makes  big problem, such as  millennium bug (some people called   ""2000 problem""), because computer  not flexible enough like a human's brain. However,  computer is worth to use in our life until  more coveniance machine will be invented. ",20.00
553," Dear Mrs Ryan: Thank's for accept me in the competition. I hear that the competition there are very good, and the Camp California is very famous for his competitions. I would like to travel on July because before  it's impossible for me and in July it's my birthday and I wish to spend my birthday at the camp, also 'cause in August the planes are full. Another thing is my accommodation I prefer to have log cabins because it's easyeast for me. I will choose for  activities tennis and swimming, I'm good on tennis because I play since 1990 and I loved it and  swimming because I like to swim and I've been  two competition and I won both. I would like to ask you for money and clothes because my parents are travelling and it is impossible for me to have  money because my sister doesn't want me to go because I'm only 14, but when I get there I promise to return  you all the money because I don't have  cash at this moment. Thanks for all, and I will be there the next month. Your sincerely Lola Villanueva.  [SEP]  ""Shopping is not always enjoyable."" For me went to shop it's not the best thing I can do. Well I think the opposite like a year before but recently I think this because I see all the people to go shopping  they don't realised that they are outside in the real world  poor people who need that money and they are only spent on material things, you would put you money in the bank because you don't need it now, but tomorrow you don't know. I like to shop sometimes but not always and not spending a lot of money on things that I don't really need. At the rest of you who don't understand this it's on your memories to keep shopping and spending all your money on things that you don't really need. And sometimes I get bored when I'm shopping because now I don't really enjoy it. Bye and think on this. Your Friend Lola Villanueva J. ",21.0
339," 17th June 2000 Dear Sir, I would like to complain about a musical show. I was very disappointing  a week holiday for me because I had got a lot of problem with the show. I had seen  the advertisement that the actors were Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, but it was not Danny Brook. I was really disappointing because he is my famous actor. The musical should started at 19.30, but it started at 20.15. When I went to asked for the discount of  ticket in the cashier desk they told me no discount  available for this. I had seen the advertisement say that  discount  available. After the show I decide to had dinner in your theatre restaurant, but I couldn't because it  closed. It closed at 10 pm but the show finished at 10.30 pm. This was not  perfect evening for me, so if you don't give  my money back, I will tell to the newspaper about it. I am looking forward to hear a good new. Yours sincerely, Boo Sersuwan.  [SEP]  I think in the next 100 years people will wear the space clothes with  small engine in the back. because of the atmosphere. The atmosphere in the earth  now starting badly every years. The  carbon dioxide are growing very fast and people cut  more trees, therefore  not enough trees to such carbon dioxide and produce oxygen. The designer will have a lot of idea for how to make very nice and useful clothes. I think if we wear this clothes we will travel to every where easier than we use cars, ships, planes and space ships. This mean the engineering will find the way to useless petrol for it, so it must useful in the future. I think somebody will make a very big area to grow plant because they can sell the oxygen. This is a new business. I think I can win this price, because this clothe will produce in the future soon. ",21.0
418," Dear sir, I bought a ticket for the ""Over the Rainbow"" musical show last Saturday, but I felt very disappointed with it. It was announced that there would be discount tickets available, but there were not. The show should have started at 19.30, but it  delayed forty-five minutes. And, the worst of all: Danny Brook was not on stage. He was replaced by a novice actor who made a very disappointing performance. Last, the theatre restaurant was closed because there was a serious leak in a tube and the kitchen was flooded. I think there are sufficient reasons for   money back. I just wanted to have a pleasant evening out and I could ever imagine that there would be so many troubles. I really expect that you  consider my arguments and cash me back the value of the ticket, as soon as possible. Yours Sincerely,  [SEP]  Several technological advances in the past five years have changed my daily life. Nowadays, I feel myself entirely linked to these innovations, and I would find it hard to live without them.  Internet is certainly the most evident of all these innovations. Information is spread quickly and you can access in minutes a wide range of data, that would take a much longer time  to be found by traditional means. For a shy person, like me,  Internet has another attractive: the possibility of knowing people and making friends worldwide. It's very exciting. Currently, I exchange e-mails with dozens of people all over the country. Celular phone can be inconvenient sometimes, but it can be very useful in certain situations: when your car is broken  on the road, when you need to be found anywhere and at any time (if you are a doctor, a lawyer or a journalist, for instance), and so forth. Modern technology granted other facilities: I can pay my bills at any time and do not need to wait on a big queue to be attended by the cashman, I can exchange photos and videos via computer, I can do business and make money at home, and so on.

1100," Dear Mr Robertson Thank you for the programme you have organised for our visit to London. We think it will be a very interesting trip, especially the sightseeing by bus. In our class, we have read an advertisement for the ""London Fashion and Leisure Show"", which will take place at the Central Exhibition Hall in London on Tuesday 14 March from 10:00 to 19:00. As we are going to be in London on this date, we think, it could be a great oppurtunity for us to go there because we are very interested in the latest fashions, make up, etc. and it is free for students. Because of this reasons, we would kindy ask you to change the programme, so that we could go to this especial event. We suggest visiting the Science Museum in the afternoon on Wednesday 15 March and canceling the Shopping on Tuesday 14 March. Hoping on your agreement and looking forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  An especiall invitation It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. I was having  holidays with my parents and some friends in India and we were enjoying talking to people and eating the local food. One day we were invited from  locals to visit a little town five hours away from New Dehli. Although my parents were very happy of having such an especial opportunity  visiting a place with no tourists, I was a little bit scared. In this country my parents used to buy water in bottles to have it clean, but in the little town we didn't had this possibility and the family where we were staying with, kindly boiled the water for us. We spent 2 weeks with the family. The first week was find, but on the second week I got very seek. I think it was the water. My mother tried to get a doctor, but they said there was no one. Some days later we went back to Dehli and having being to the doctor and having again  bottled water, I was feeling healthy again. ",34.00
489," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to inform you about the differences between the advertisment and the real show. I am also expecting to get some money back. First of all, the show started 45 minutes late. We all had to sit and wait because there was nobody to explain the reason of the delay and excuse about it. If there was someone to do so, we could have gone out to eat something. Then, as we were told that the show was begginning, the second shock of the evening faced us. Instead of the famous actor Danny Brook, a very bad and disappointing actor showed up. Watching the show plus the 45 minutes of delay made us hungry of course so we decided to eat at the theatre restaurant. As it was too late, the restaurant was closed and we starved till we got to our homes. We were also disappointed because there were no discounts! (As I mentioned above) I was very disappointed and I am asking for some money back if possible.  [SEP]  PAT AND SECRETS .... Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Knowing that he decided to not to see Alison until the birthday party. Everybody was given a job, and Pat's job was buying the cake and the candles. The best bakery was at the other side of the town so there was no danger for him to see Alison and reveal the party. He went out of his house and got on his bike to go to the bakery. On his way he saw lots of places he could buy the birthday cake but knowing that the safest one was the one which is as  andy as Alison's house he kept on riding. When he reached the bakery, he was quite relieved and he almost forgot that he had a secret to keep.  Picking the best cake he was preparing to go back. He suddenly saw Alison and said ""Did you like the cake, it's for your birthday party"". After the conversation was over Pat still wasn't aware of what he had done, and he didn't find out till the party took place. ",32.0
439," Dear Sir, Last week, I had visited your theatre and I was very disappointed because I did not have a perfect evening out like what  advertisement said. I would like to complain  four things about your theatre. Fist thing, the actor is very horrible so I recommend you to change the actor because he will make an audience who visit you theatre disappoint. Second thing, you should open the show on time because if the audience have to wait, they will not feel happy but I think you know that. According to the advertisement, it said tickets £ 10, £ 15 and £ 20 discounts available but when I bought the ticket, the discounts did not available After the show I was very hungry so I went to the restaurant in the theatre but it was closed for decorating that make me very angry and disappoint. To conclude, your theatre is not good like what advertisement said so I would like to ask for some money back. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully, (Chan Suntavee)  [SEP]  Nowadays, science and technology are very important to our life. The technology make my daily life change a lots compare to the past. For example, when I was young, I used to walk to school everyday but now my father has a car so I don't have to walk anymore, because my father gives me a lift everyday. At home, I have a video game so I play it all the time and I'm very enjoy that  make my daily life happy so it's excellent but on the other hand I didn't do any homework or study at all. Another example is  computer, I don't have to watch television or read a newspaper because I can know the news by using  internet in the computer. To sum up, the modern technology has changed my daily life in bad ways and good ways. Therefore my daily life will change to bad ways or goods ways, it depends on how I use the technology. ",21.0
176," Dear Sir As I thought your advertisement was interesting, I went there but it was not  good as it should be. First of all, the actor was not Danny Brook as you wrote. Secondly, it ought to start at 19:30 but it really started at 20:30. According to the advertisement, the discounts were available. In fact, I had to pay the full price which costed me £15. After the show I intended to visit the theatre restaurant but it was closed because as you have known that the show started late, therefore the restaurant had closed before the show finished. As I have informed you  all the fact, I think the show was not worth the money I paid, so I want the refund for £15. I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible. Your faithfully  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. The story begins when Jan, who was Pat's best friend, told Pat that she saw Tim when he was cheating  the exam. The next day, Pat told everybody what she had heard from Jan, so when the news came to  teachers' ears, the teachers decided to give Tim  grade F in that subject and tell his parents!! Tim, who was the most powerful bully, was punished by his parents and of course by the teachers. He was furious with Jan, so what happened was Jan was bullied but not because of her fault, it was Pat's. Actually, I think it was right to tell the teachers but not in Pat's way. It would have been better for both Pat and Jan if they had told the teachers privately and secretly because Tim would haven't known who had told the teachers. Now, Jan has still been bullied nearly everyday. Her parents have been so upset that they have asked the school to help thier child and that is the reason why I'm writing this story. If all of us try to help her, I'm sure that we can make her a better school life. ",28.0

London is a good place for discovering it. We've seen an advertisement for 'the London Fashion and Leisure Show' and all of us are very interested in it. It's an exhibition of fashions, sport wears, make up and hairstyles. We think it is a great opportunity because there are some people in our class who like to study fashions after leaving this school. And everyone of us is interested in fashions and clothes! This exhibition is situated in  Central Exhibition Hall, London. We've noticed that the exhibition will be on Tuesday,  14th of March. Could we change our programme? We'd like to do our shopping tour on  next following day (Wednesday afternoon) instead of Tuesday afternoon. What do you think about our suggestion? Please write back as soon as possible. We hope to hearing from you soon. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Basle, 12th Decembre 2000 Dar Oxana, Thanks for your letter. It's nice to hear from you again. In your letter, you asked me wheter the book I've read would be a suitable present for your cousin's fifteenth birthday. It's my pleasure to write my suggestion for you now! You know I love reading books, it's my passion. I've read all the books of  English author Ernest Hemingway. They are great I tell you! But I think your cousin is too young for it. Why? Because he especially concentrates on  history, social life and politic situation in the time the story is played. That might be quiet complicated to understand, especially for young people. For me, his books are great. But anyway, do you know the book with the title 'The Best Detective Stories of Agatha Christie'? It's written by Agatha Christie. She's an American and her books concentrate on crime and detective stories. Her books aren't difficult to understand. She especially write books for young people. And I think this book is a very good one for your cousin. You wrote that your cousin is quite intered in magic, detectives and sport, didn't you? I think this is the best choice for him! I've send you a copy of the summary from the book and an interesting article about the author and the book. Please read it and write your comments. I hope to hearing from you soon! Have fun with it and say hello to your cousin! See you soon! Love, ",16.00
139," Mr Soren: Let me express how disappointed I feel at this particular moment, or I should say angry, better sad. I would never expected that I could be so decepted. This is not the firt time I have been in your theatre and I have to tell you I have enjoyed many other plays, but be sure ""Over the rainbow"" will be the last one. As I am specially fond of musicals, I even travel abroad to see what's new, I am probably one of the most devoted customers. I know this word is not the best but you have demostrated that the theatre can be just as cold as any other business. We both know this is not true, or shoudn't be. When someone comes specially to see Danny Brook acting, one of my favourites singers, whose career I have been following since the begining, and  never appear, and nobody give any reason to the audience, how should one feel? There was no reason either for the delay. Almost an hour! Can you imagine how many things one can do instead. Even listening some music to help us take it easy would had been better than nothing! None an announcement, not an invitation...oh, yes, I forgot. The bar was closed. Well, I will not comment  that point. That terrible place definitively needed a renewal. Well, this is not my idea of a perfect evening out, as you can realise. Each time I see the advertising I get mad. Of course, you shoud make a refund of the money , not only to me but to all the public. But I can say that you will never be able to give my appreciation for your theatre back, at least till you continue as its manager. Expecting your news,  [SEP]  It is almost true to say that fashion is one of the most exciting human activities nowadays. How can we define this crazy and continuous change of colours, shapes, patterns, and uses? New fabrics create new textures, all kind of accesories are added to create new versions, to refresh old ideas, to make new proposals that will last, like always, just some weeks. All  in fashion pass away in a couple of months and has to be created again. Fashion is a part of our lives, even for those who will never reconize it. Have you notice that all the classic gentlemen wear  same tipe of suit? And what about this kind of intellectual and progressive people, don't they wear all the same model of ugly but confortable shoes? I am sure that fashion will survive for ages, even it will change to become easier to use and clean, because we all need to feel a part of our society, comunicate our way of living and thinking, be part of a group and, at the same time be different. The future will bring to us new concepts, adapted to our lives. ",24.0
94," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to you to complain about the musical show ""Over the Rainbow"". I have recently been in London for spending a week's holiday. As I am an enthusiasmic of musicals I went to see this musical show. I am very disappointed because the things that were writen on the advertisment were not really true. It was writen that the stars would be Danny Brook and Tina Truelove. Danny Brook is one of my favorite actors and there was playing another one. I felt abosolutly disapointed. The musical should have begun at 19:30, but it started at 20:15; it is inacceptable! It was writen too that there were discounts available and I asked for them and they said me that they weren't allow to do any discount. After the show me and my friends wanted to have a drink and the theatre restaurant was closed because there weren't enough drinks. As you say in your advertisment it was not my perfect evening out and therefore I would like to have my money back. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully, Ms MARIA AROZ  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed our daily life? Modern technology has changed a lot our daily life. On one hand nowadays if we have to travel to Paris and return in the same day you can take a plane without any problem. In the past it was impossible to go to Paris from Barcelona and come back in one day. Another advantage is that if you go on an excursion and you take your mobile phone, if you get lost somebody could find you. I think that the most important  modern technology in these days is  internet. With  internet you can do whatever you want without going out home (shoping, speaking with a friend, working, putting your money aside....) On the other hand the main disadvantage is that using modern machines it can be very difficult for ederly people; it would be very pratitable if the modern industries train people about using modern technologies. To sum up modern technology has change a lot our daily life and this is going to increase. ",24.0
962," Warsaw, 13th of June 2000 Dear Mrs. Ryan, I am writing in response to your letter which I received two days go and in order to answer all questions I was asked to. First of all, the only month I will be able to visit the U.S.A. is July due to the fact that I have already arranged another trip for August. Second of all, I would prefer to live in a tent. I am used to this kind of accommodation since I have been taking part in survival camps for a long time. As far as the activities are concerned, I have chosen sailing and surfing. The reason of my decision is that other activities are availiable to take also in my county, except climbing, but I have  fear of heights so this one is not destinated for people like me. Furthermore, I would like to ask you some questions. What type of clothes should I take and how much money would be enough? Is this a kind of ""all inclusive"" holidays? Thank you in advance. Yours faithfully, Ursula Sobczak  [SEP]  Warsaw, 13 June 2000 Dear Kim, I think I told you about my plans of entering a group that helps at concerts, didn't I? Well, I took my chance and I was chosen to help at Michael Jackson's concert. Amazing, isn't it? The event took place a month ago in the Rock Stadium. There was about 100 000 people. We had a lot of things to do. Acctually, they put me very close to the stage, in the middle of the real hell. Many people fainted and some of them, the most serious cases, had to be taken to hospital. The biggest problem was connected with some foreigners who couldn't speak Polish or English and we didn't know how to help them. Despite this fact, the atmosphere was terrific. After the concert many people lost their way home, mostly foreigners who didn't know the buses' schedule. We had to order taxis for them as they didn't have mobile telephones. However, they were very nice people. I didn't manage to meet Michael as I had expected, but apart from that, I really enjoyed  time I spent there. You should also try . Best wishes, Ursula. ",37.0
708," Dir Madam! I'm realy enjoyed I won your competition! I'll give you  nessesserly information about me. The most suitable time for me is Jule because in August I intend to go in the countryside, where I have a small farm. In September my school starts a new study year. So, because of that I can only  then. I'd like to stay in the log cabins, because I don't like wet places like tends after rain. You ofer me a lot of activities. I play basketball and tennis very well. I went to try surfing and climbing because I've never done it. I've got also two questions. How much money  I need to stay at Camp California and what kind of clothes I should take with me? Please let me know! Regards!  [SEP]  Dear Kim! Thank you for your letter, which arrived this morning. I'm glad you're doing well. You'd like to know how was the Top-Pop Concert, which I helped to organise last month. It was absolutlly great! I was responsible about a security of one of the sectors. I gave information about correct ways to another places like tooletes and medical points. I was also asked about a timetable of the concert and I looked for drugs, knifes and so on in bags. Although I worked I watched the concert. I was big fun! People danced, screamed and sung with a singer. I looked very carefully at  organisation of the event, you know I'm interestsing in it. OK. I'd better stop now because I'm going to go to a library. I look forward to hear some news from you! Take care! ",25.0
651," Dear Helen Ryan, I am glad that I have won first prize in your competition. I have been very surprised winning. You ask me in your letter when I would like to travel. The answer is the following one: I only can travel  July because I have to work all August. I can take holidays only  the month of July. You ask me if I prefer to sleep in tents or log cabins. I prefer the tents because I never use such kind of accommodation. I have choosen the two following activities. First one is Tennis and  second one is sailing. I played tennis for many years. I have even done competitions. I like a lot this game. I have choosen sailing because I would like to try a new sport. I love water but I never try this sport before. I would like to ask you two questions. How much money do I have to take with me for these two weeks and what kind of clothes do I have to bring with me? I'll be very happy to see you soon. Yours sincerly. Yves DUTEIL  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable. Shopping is not always enjoyable because of different problems. The first thing is the place of shopping. Sometimes you have to go far away from home to do your shopping and it takes a lot of time. The second thing is that you need to go shopping when the supermarkets are open. Many people work late and they do not have enough time to go for shopping. The third thing is the trouble of full shops. Everybody do their shopping at the same moment and often in the same place. It is almost a battle to buy different things and to go paying  those things. People are often nervous and agressive. Sometimes you can see fights between two men or women. There is one more thing. When you are a man and your wife asks you to come for shopping, be patient! Because women loves shopping and you have to follow them everywhere and always giving your opinion about clothes, music, parfums... ",29.0
1027," 12th December 2000 Dear Mr. Robertson, I would like to thank you for organising a nice programme for us. Especially, going to the Museum and the Art Gallery would be a great oppotunity for all of us, as they are world-famous places in London. However, there is something I need to ask you. Everyone in the class wishes to go to the London fashion and leisure show which will be held on Tuesday 14th March from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. In the show, we will be able to see the latest fashion, leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles. It would be essential because many people in the class are thinking of studying fashion in future. The entrance fee is free for students so the show is well worth seeing. To go to the show, we need to alter the programme. The show is on 14th and takes a whole day. So, if we could go to the Museum by using the free time on 15th it would be okay although we could not go shopping. I look forward to hearing from you shortly. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Story It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. Three years ago, when I was in Japan, my parents were both working and neither of them were at home by the time I get back from the school. I always had my own key and unlock the door by myself. It was a horrible day, the day I had left my key at home! There was nobody to let me in, noway to contact with my parents. What I decided to do was getting into the house by climbing up the roof because I knew one of the windows was unlocked. First, I climbed the tree in the garden. It was okay, beause I was quite good at that, but the problem was that I had to jump onto the roof! It had been raining, the previous day, so the roof was slippy! I managed to do that although I cut my knee! I walked on the roof carefully,  not to slip. I was extremely happy when I got into the house. It was a scary, but thrilling and exciting incident!

721," June 13th, 2000 Dear Mrs. Ryan, First of all thank you very much for the good news that I have won the first price in your competition. I am very delighted and already looking forward to spending two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A.. As regards the time that I can travel I must tell you that my holidays at university are only in July. I hope that it wouldn't be a problem for you and that I can go to the Camp California at some time in July. I would like to stay in a log cabin as I have an allergie against grass. Then you asked  to chose two activities from the list you sent to me. I would like to do surfing and photography. I am a total beginner in both activities, but I think that these two weeks will be a good opportunity to learn something about them. Finally I have also some questions to you. Firstly I would like to know what kind of clothes will be appropriate for the camp, secondly how much money I should take with me for the two weeks and lastly if there are any possibilies for cooking. yours sincerely,  [SEP]  'Shopping is not always enjoyable' If you have to go shopping again, because the fridge is empty or you need some new clothes, a lot of time, patience and straingth are needed. All kinds of shopping have more and more become to a rather stressful activity than an enjoyable on. I often begins with finding a parking for the car, which can take more than 15 minutes. Leaving the car at home is also not a good ideas  you often buy so much that you can't carry it in plastic-bags. The next stressful factor begins in the shop: Everywhere people who are in a hurry and push you from one side to the other. Consuming has become a very important thing for them. And if you are not quick enough they won't leave  anything left. But there occure also problems if there are products left: either you can't decide between two things or your favourite product is too expensive. Having finally decided and got what you wanted to, the next torture comes at the cash-desk, when you have to pay. You have to wait at a long queue for more than 15 minutes. So even if it's nice to have food or new clothes at home, without patience, time and straingth you should better stay at home or try to find the most convenient time for shopping. ",31.0
894," Dear Helen, I have received your letter this morning and I'm very happy for this first prize. It's a great opportunity for me participate in your Camp California because normaly I work a lot and I can't spend money to travel, moreover, I have to maintain my big family because I'm married and I have three children. I would like to travel in July because before  I have to work with my father because he's ill. For de accommodation I  prefer a long cabin because it's more comfortable. I recognise that I would like to sleep in a tent but in this moment I have a little problem with my right leg and it's better for me to sleep in a bed. I know that I have the chance to do two activities during this time. I have to choose painting and the photography therefore. I would prefer surfing or climbing but I have to think in my helth. In your letter you explain me that all accommodation and travel costs are paid for but I need to know if the life in Camp California is expensive or not because I have to bring money. The weather I hope will be good so I suppose I have to bring short clothes. I'm very enthousiastic and I attend your answer as soon is possible. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  In our society the money is one of the most important aspect to have power. If we thing about , we will realise that we need money all the day. Not only for the basic needs but also for the rest of the activities. There are a lot of people who spend a lot of money because they like shopping. Sometimes, they have to buy something that they need but frequently, they buy  only to spend money. This is a big problem because a lot of families haven't money, however spend going shopping. We have to teach to our children the value of the money, to explain the difficulties  to earn money in a job, because we have to work eight, nine or ten hours a day, for example. It's a first step to educate the youngest and to help our society. The money is important but we have to know how to spend it: shopping is not always enjoyable. ",24.0
1094,"  Dear Mr Robertson, I'm writing  you because I had been asked to make a little suggestion about the programme your have organised to our English class travel. First of all, thank you for the programme, we think it is very good, especially the river trip to greenwich, we believe we will enjoy  a lot going to greenwich. Moreover, in our opinion, this travel is going to be very interesting for us. On the other hand, we have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure show and we would all like to go the show. We think it is a good opportunity because london fashion is the most important over the world, and we all learn a lot about London style going to this show. We think we could change  shooping  for going to the show. The show is free, and it is only on Tuesday 14th of March. It is open from 10.00 until 19.00, and we could go there on the afternoon. Thank you for your attention. We are looking forward to your answer, Yours sincerely  [SEP]   Thinking about the media's treatment of famous people, I've realised of some things. On my point of view the media's treatment of famous people is very bad. The media's are looking forward to create great expectations about famous people. They are not trying to give information, they are only looking to get money, and to entertain the public. On the other hand, if the media's are acting in that way  is because of the society. The society  is who increases the audience of the media, if nobody gave attention to the famous people private lifes, this treatment would finish. But in my opinion, before you get famous you know which are the consequences. As in another  you may know what could happen. To sum up, there is no job perfect, and be famous involves a lof  money, but also a lot of jouralists following your private life. ",27.00
382," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing in connection with the musical show your theatre company has presented recently, and, I want you to know, it has really disappointed me. To begin with, the actor the advertisement showed did not come, which I found it in very bad taste,  disappointing. Moreover, the show started at a quarter past eight, forty-five minutes later than it might have been. I paid twenty pounds for my ticket because, as you may know, there were not  discounts available. It is for this reason, I think you should return me some money back. To sum up, I would like to make my point about what happened in the restaurant after that. It was closed because its owner had decided to go on holiday. However, nobody told me. I think you would have to take it into consideration to avoid it happens again. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. If I had know it before, I would have never told her, because then, that was really important for me, but, anyway, presently, it doesn't really matter  me. By the time, Pat and me had a close relationship. I explained her everything it happened to me and vice versa. We had many points in common and we knew each other as if we were sisters. However, one day our friendship was broken down. I told her I was falling in love with my best friend and she decided to explain it everybody in our group, despite knowing that  must be a secret. When I met Caballos, my best friend, I felt embarassd and disappointed and I couldn't say anything. I was at a loss. Now I wish all of this had never happened, while I try to forget it laughing with Caballos and Pat. ",28.0
826," Dear Ms Ryan, Thank you for your letter. I am very happy to hear that I have won the first prize. I am writing to inform you about my requests. I also have some questions. First, I was wondering if I could travel in July. I am working at a language school. Due to a shortage of teachers in summer I can take holiday only in July. Second, I would like to sleep in a tent because I have never slept in a tent and I have wanted to sleep there. Third, I have chosen 'Tennis' and 'Photography' for my activities at the Camp. I have been playing tennis for over ten years. In addition, I have been teaching children to play tennis for three years. I took up taking photos four years ago. Since then I have entered ten competitions and won the first prize three times. Finally, could you please let me know what kind of clothes I should take with me? I would also like to know how much money I should take with me. I am looking forward to hearing from you and travelling to the U.S.A. Yours sincerely, Chi Kimura  [SEP]  Dear Kim, Last month I helped at a pop concert. The name of the band was 'Dream Comes True'. This bank is not only in Japan but also in the U.S.A very famous. I am still excited while I am writing to you about my experience. First, I helped to prepare the stage before the band arrived. The music instruments were transported from the lorries (three big lorries!) into the concert hall and I helped to put them at the right position on the stage. They were very heavy and I had to carry them with care because they were very important for the band. After that I helped to test lights and microphones. I almost fainted when the band arrived and entered the stage. I am a fan of this band and I have never seen them in  flesh. The most exciting thing about my experience was that the band spoke to me after the concert. The band was very satisfied with the stage and appreciated our work. I was so exited and happy that I can't remember what I talked with the band . I want to help at a pop concert again! I am looking forward to hearing from you. Best wishes, ",36.0
746," Dear Miss Helen Ryan I was so suprise to hear from you. I couldn't believe that I had won the first prize on the competition. I'm so happy because it is the first time that I win something. Here it is all your information. I would like  if you could to have my vacation trip on July because  is the only time of the year that my job could let me have a vacation. As for the accommodation I would prefer the tent because it is my first time that I'm going to camping and I would like to see how the real life is. I was so thrilled when I saw that I could do some activities also. I would like to choose swimming and the climbing. I'm a very good swimmer but I don't know anything about climbing that's why I choose it because I want to try something knew. At last I would like to ask you about my clothes and how the weather is going to be and what kind of clothes I must to take with me. That is all. Thank you for making my dream come true Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Everyone has likes and dislikes. But noone is doing what he likes all the time. There is times that you have to do something even if you don't like it, and times that you are doing what you like but not  the time you  like it. What I'm trying to say is that I like to shop but I can't do that all the time. First because I'm not so rich and second because I don't enjoy to shop all the time. Nothing in life is always enjoyable  even the things we enjoy to do, and that's how life is. You say you enjoy shopping I understand but life goes on you can't do the same things every day. live your life and try to do different things and you will see that to do different things is exciting and more fun. You don't have to be bored with the same old things. Because as I said to do what you like is good only if you do it when you like it and how you like it and remember if you have  long time to do something the you enjoy it more. ",25.0
896," Dear Helen Ryan, I am very happy to have won first prize in your competition. I am very interested in going to two weeks at Camp California in the USA. I would like to travel on July, because it is the summer and the weather is sunny, moreover I am totally free during this month. For the accommodation, I would prefer a log cabin, because I can not sleep in  tent. I like to do sports and I would like to do sailing and surfing for speed sensations. I am good in those two activities, because I go to the sea every weekend. I would like to now more information about clothes. I think that  weather is very hot and that the nights are not cold, but I do not know if I must take  lot of pullovers. Best regards Henri  [SEP]  ""Shopping is not always enjoyable"" is a statement  of men in general. Women like to go to do shopping, but not alone and they want to motivate their husbands. Men do not like shopping, because their women buy a lot of clothes and it is very expensive. Moreover, men prefer to do sports, because the shopping loses a lot of time  controry to  women, because if they have a free time, they will go to do shopping. I think that  child does not like shopping because he often waits, and I prefer to play with these friends. He goes to do shopping only if he has not clothes. To conclude, I think that ""Shopping is not always enjoyable"" is a true statement, but not always for all people. ",25.0
262," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to complain about the show, ""Over the Rainbow"" which I saw in your theatre last week. I was really disappointed because the show was far from what I expected. First of all, I was really expecting to see Danny Brook, my favourite actor. However, he was not on the stage that day. Secondally the show started late and I had to wait for 45 minutes without doing anything. It was a waste of time. I also thought that there should have been discounts for students, which in fact was not available and I had to pay for  normal price. Furthur more, the restaurant in the theatre was closed after the show because of the delay. I had to go home without eating a dinner, though I was really hungry. I have to say that the evening was terrible. If I had known all of them, I would have changed my plan and could have a better time. I strongly suggest you should give us  right information. I also would like to claim some refund for the evening. I hope this matter will receive your prompt attention. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Fashion in 100 years If you compare the fashion now with that of 100 years ago, you'll notice that there are incredably big difference between them. People have become more informal, casual and practical than before. But how about the fashion of the future, for example, 100 years from now? I think it'll also be very different from now. But in which way? First of all, people might think more about the function of clothes than the design. For example, they'll wear a cloth which protect themselves from air pollution, sunshine etc. Imagine that all the people have masks on their mouthes and noses like we have sun-glasses, and that all the masks are designers brands, which are made of  special material to prevent us from breathing in polluted air. It's like a joke, but a bit scarely. Imagine that all the people have hats with big edges to protect their faces from  sun-burn, and it's the most trendy fashion of the year! It's funny. But we never know!! ",32.0
492," 17th June 2000 Dear Sir or Madam, I am just coming back from a week's holiday in London, which has been all in all really nice. The only thing which really disapointed me was a visit in your theatre where I wanted to see the musical 'over the rainbow', after I read the advertisement for the show. The things that really dissapointed me were that you said Danny Brook and Tina Truelove were suposed to be the actors but they weren't, different actors played and to be honest they made the hole show very bad. Also the show was supposed to start at 19.30 but finally it started at 20.15 and that is such a waste of others people time. Another thing was that you said discounts are available which is very important for students, but no their weren't any. Also after the show your restaurant was closed because their wasn't enough staff. To be honest that was not a great expierence and I hope you will see my point. In that case I also want to ask you for my money back. I think you will understand that and   looking forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully T. Herschel  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed your daily life? Since everyone can afford modern technology the life of everyone in the more developed countries has changed completly. We can't imagine to live without it anymore because we are so dependent of it. It starts already in the morning that we wake up by the sound of an alarm clock, than in the bathroom we have running hot water and also the hole house is warm due to central heating. Then we can just go to the fridge where all the fresh food is stored ready to eat. If we than want to go to work we don't have to get our horse, no, we get the car keys and go where ever we want to. At work we have the most important thing in the world of technology, the computer. Without that we can't do anything today. So in the last century our daily life changed dramandesly and we became lazy and our life unpersonal, fast and unromantic. Noone can think about a life without commuters or electricity. But we can't say the new technology has done just bad things in our life because otherwise we couldn't have made such progress in all the sciences and other subjects ",31.0
658," Dear Sir/Madam First of all I would like to say thanks for your letter and your care about your customers. I was absolutely threaled to resive  news about my win in a competition. Your letter contains  few questions about  detailes of my holiday which I would like to clarify for you. The first is  time. I am only able to go on holiday in July, because the other time I have college, which I can't be missed. The second is accommodation. I old rather prefer stay in log cabins than live in tents. I don't like night cold and moscitos. I  so glad, that I will get  chance to do activities in the camp. I play basketball and at tennis. I  quite good at tennis. What about basketball is. I played in  school team, and was one of the best players by the end of this season. There is one more thing which I would like to know about. It is  clothes and money. Should I have any special , if yes what kind of wear it is. And of course there will be expenses. Can you inform me how much money should I have and can I have some information about prices  to visit local places of interests. At the end I would like ones more to say thanks for your letter and I look forward to hearing from you by post with all  detailes about  holiday. Yours faithfyly  [SEP]  I hate shopping but in the other hand sometimes you can have fun at it. In my opinion, it dependes on your mood, your financial ability, off course where you are going to do shopping and what you are going to buy. Usualy people don't have time for shopping. You've just finished your long hours at work, you  tide, you had  row with your boss but you are still going to do shopping. And what  you have. There are huge queus to  tills, noise, hussle, poor custumer service. You've got more stress, you feel fed up and finaly when you got home you think that shopping is not that enjoyable as you thought. For example a lot of people do not like to do shopping in big stores. It takes hours to buy something. There are so many varaity of products, different prices, different quality. You should walk miles around  store to find what you wanted. Yes, there is  big plus for  big store of course. You can find everything in one place, instead of small shops which is specialised on one product. And people spend all weekends walking around shopping cities and high streets in trills to buy something. Nower days tecnical progress gets close to us, to usual custumers.  Internet is one of the issue at this problem. Without any hussle, seating in your chear in front of your computer you in  second can get in at any shop who has  internet site, most of the big companies have it, get all  information about  product, get  cheaper price and buy it.

768," Thank you for your answer. I'm happy I can join you at Camp California in the U.S.A. I'm sorry to say that I can attend your camp only on July because I just started my new job and I got one month of my holiday, which are on July. You wrote to me that I can choice my accommodation. I would prefer stay in log cabins because I have a problem with my back it is a reason that I can't lie on the ground. Beside that I'm alergic,  that make me problem when I'm close to the nature. You wrote to me that I have a chance to do two activities, which I can choice. I'm quite good in paiting and I play tennis. I'll be very happy when you can give me a chance to use the camp's art studio and you'll be able to prepare some paiting's materials like oil paints canvas and bruches for me. The size of the canvas isn't so important. I have my own sports equipment to play tennis. I hope I'll have  possibility to improve my ability in it. I'm champion of my town, so I think I can find a right person who can play with me. Could you write to me, because I don't know how much money I need and what type of weather do you have in this time of the year. Your sincerelly  [SEP]  Dear Kim! Last month we had the pop concert of our favourite polish group ""THE CULT"" in Warshaw. I had the chance to help at the concert. You can't imagine how happy I was. I got money for that job and I enjoyed the work a lot. You know I'm good in mace-up and I have done many times scenography. They were pleased that I can do two of this job that's why I got the work. I was working like crazy but I enjoyed  a lot. I didn't sleep two nights because I was preparing the stage where they made the concert. Could you imagine that they asked me to make the summer scenography. I heard, the atmosphere of their concerts is very hot but I didn't know they like to create this even by scenography. Could you believe that two nights I was cutting paper's flowers, grass, the sun and thousands of birds. I didn't have many people who was helping me that's why I was working 48 hours without stopping. I think the result of that action was marvelous. Everybody was very suprise that you can create such amazing things, using a sizors and papers. I like a lot the mountains which I made. From the distance they looked very real. I just rulled a paper and I painted a little white colours on the top. In front of the stage I put the grass and a lot of flowers. The light on the stage was very bright and very warm what's made the scenery very pleasent. After that I prepared the group. I done  mace-up for them. I was very happy because on this time I had a chance talking to them and to know more about them. They are very nice people even Audrey who seems very stupid. She is very intelligent. I really don't know why she behave herself so badly during her interview. I got their address so we can visit them one day. I told them about you and they said we are very welcome any time. I told them you are full of live and they are yours favourite polish group. They  like to know you a lot. We'll speak about it when I come to see you. I hope to see you soon. A lot of kisses. ",23.0
996," Dear Miss Ryan, I'm writing to you as regards the letter you've sent me about the competition I've won. I've never been to the U.S.A. before so I think it'll be an exciting trip. With regard to the date of the trip, July would be best because in June I'm going to visit my family in Mexico and in August school begins. I've never been camping before, I guess I'm not an outdoor girl, but I'd like to give it a try, so I'd rather tents than cabins. I'm really keen on sports, especially sailing. I've practised sailing since an early age and I perfectly manage the rigging and sail. I'm also fond of tennis, I've just started my lessons and would like to continue practising during the summer. So, I think I'll do sailing and tennis. I'm not really sure of what kind of clothes to take, could you please write to me specifying what would be suitable? I'd appreciate it a lot. Sincerely, Diana Delgado  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable I'm a shopaholic, but I have to admit shopping is not always enjoyable. For instance, I spent my Spring Break with my friends in Italy, we went there to buy our dresses for our boyfriends' graduation (besides other reasons). They had invited us and we wanted them to see us  stunningly beautiful. While we were in Florence my wallet was stolen, probably by a gypsie. I was so annoyed! I was in the Plaza Espagna in Florence without a penny! My friends lent me some money, but it wasn't more than 120 pounds. I had to buy my dress, it's accesories and besides clothes and souvenirs! I couldn't really do much, so I used the money I had and bought an incredible pair of shoes and some souvenirs. I felt really bad seeing my friends buy the latest fashion while the only thing I could do was tell them how great their clothes were and of course window-shop. ",40.0
1113," Dear Mr Robertson, I would like first, in the name of my whole class, to thank you for all you've done for us and for our trip to London. We've just been told about your programme and I must say that we all like it! What I am most looking forward to, is the River trip to Greenwich; but I would also really like to visit the Science Museum as well as the National Gallery! This will be very enriching for us! You must wonder why I'm writing to you, them! ... well actually we've must received an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show, and the vast majority of the class would like to go and see it. This will take place in the Central Exhibition Hall on Tuesday 14th March. We thought it would be a great experience for us since we quite don't have such opportunities in our everyday life! Moreover, the entrance is free for the students so that won't raise the cost for the trip. I thought we should visit the Science Museum on Monday afternoon so that we could do the River trip on Tuesday morning just before going to the fashion show! Anyway, we were to go shopping on Tuesday afternoon so that won't be a problem to my mind! I hope you will take account of our request, Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  It was dangerous but I knew I had to do it. George was about to be linched on account of his colour skin. Someone had to react ... I had to react! ... otherwise I would have felt responsible for his death, for the rest of my life. George was leaning on the floor, surrounded by his own lake of blood. He had just been beaten by a ground of white men. And yet, he was too weak to resist the rats, coming from everywhere and eating his face, his legs and his arms, waiting with great impatience for his death. He had been chained and no way could he escape from his fate without some help! The place where I was hidden was overlooking the house where he was kept prisonner. No one was garding him. They were all celebrating their victory with a gorgeous dinner around the fire place. I tiptoed as far as the house, carefully opened the door, and headed to George. At the very moment when he say me, his eyes began to shine and I could feel that he had recovered some hope. I delivered him and we were about to flee, taking back our dignity and freedom overwhelmed with join, when we saw a whiteman, targelting his gun at us, and about to shoot ... ",39.00
852," Dear Ms Ryan I'm writing to reply to your questions about Camp California. First of all, thank you very much for giving me such a good opportunity. I'm very pleased and I'd like to go to the States as soon as possible, however I'm free only in July. Currently I'm studying in England and the school finishes at the end of June. After that I will go back to Japan and continue studying at College, but it stats at the beginning of August. As for the accommodation I would prefer log cabins. I'm not a kind of person who can easily fall a sleep and it gets worse when I am in a tent. At the Camp I'd like to do climbing and golf. I belonged to a climbing club at my highschool and I've got a lot of knowledge from my experienced teacher. I often climbed mountains when I was in high school. My golf teacher is my father and I've only played in a practicing centre, but my father and his friends say I have good talent of golf. Lastly I'd like to ask you some questions. That is how many and what sort of clothes I need and how much money I should bring. I'm looking forward to your reply. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  I think we should follow our time table if we make a video about daily school life, but we cannot film every lessons so I picked up some interesting ones. Firstly we should defnitely put the news review lesson , because we start every morning with that class and it is where we have a lot of discussion. Secondly I think the FCE class should be filmed. Most of us (students) came to our school because they wanted to study English, so it should be the important part. In addition if we film the class, people can see how interesting or funny the lesson is. Then why don't we film our lunch time because it is also important, isn't it? I think we should film it at the very crowded moment so that people can see we have to wait patiently before we reach our foods. I think nextly we can film either the development class or the society class, because in my opinion they are the most interesting classes apart from the FCE class. For the very last part why not filming our faces when all the lessons are finished? ",38.0
75,"  Dear Sir I'm writting to express my feeling and opinion about the International Arts Festival which held a few days ago. When I found the advertisement of  International Arts Festival, I was very excited. It is great to hold an annual international arts festival in the place. Then I spent two days at the festival. I enjoyed it very much. There were so many exciting things I saw, such as stars and artists from around the world. Jazz, rock and classical concerts, plays and dance show etc. The specified thing  is worth to remind here is the reasonably-priced ticket for all events, it is excellent because most tourist could offer what they like. Although how I enjoyed it, there were still something  needed to be improved. For example, there were some conert halls which was too small to hold so much people, the stars and artists were just from six countries, which is not enough for  audience. In the addition when you organize the next year's international arts festival, could you arrange more plays and films. Thanks for reading this letter, I'm looking forward to the next year's festival. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Dear Magda It is lovely to get your letter so soon. You mentioned the rules at home and at school in the letter. This remind me of what I experienced during my teeenage . In my country the children go to the secondary school when they are at the first year of  teenage. Your know, this age is the trouble age, boys have too much energy and girls want to fall in love with someone. These always annoy the school teacher and  parents. In a result of these the teachers make very strict rules at school, such as students aren't allowed to speak  each other in the class. They had to finish homework in a limited time. They cannot oppose to the teacher, girls are not allowed to  make up and wear any accessories. At home, in my experience, my parents didn't allow me to go out in the evening and gave me much amsh homework to do, even in the holiday. They also forbidden me to make a boyfriend. I think it is not just what happened in my home many of my friend had the same experience. Now I'm a mother of two children. They are all in the school. Comparing to my experience, I want to give them  more open attitude about everything. I want to be a mother of them and a friend of them. But at school, although I hope the teacher don't give students so much homework,  don't forbidden the opposite voice of the students, there are nothing I can do because of our culture. It's quite sad. I'm looking forward to receiving your next letter soon. Best wishes ",21.00
730," Dear Ryan Thank you for your letter and I am very pleased to hear from you about my winning of the competition. I am writing to inform you  my preferences and ask a few questions about the camping. First of all, I would like to travel in July because I can apply my holiday only in July. I have discussed it with my boss but he allowed me to go on a holiday only in July. And about accommodation, I would like to stay in a tent. I know that staying in a log cabin is more convinient but I just want to feel  wilder experience. While I am at the camp, I would like to enjoy swimming and photography. It will be a wonderful experience to swim in a lake and I can relax and enjoy  fresh air. Photography is one of my hobbies so I want to take nice photos in the camp area as many as I can. I would like to know about the weather in the camp area because I don't know what kinds of clothes I have to bring. And I want to know how much money I have to carry for personnal expences. I also want to know if I can have a time for shopping. Thank you for your kindness and I look forward to your reply. Yours sincerely, Clark. ",12.0
362," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to make some complaints about the musical show ""Over the Rainbow"",  wich you are the manager. I would like to say that there were many problems with the musical show. The first problem concerned the main actor of the show. Although it was written in the show's addvertisement that the main actor was Danny Brook, it, unfortunately, was not him. The show was supposed to have started at 19:30, but it only started at 20:15, so the public, including me, was forced to wait for fourty five minutes. It was also written in the show's addvertisement that there would be discounts available for the tickets. However, there was not any. The fourth problem concerned the Theatre Restaurant. Even though the addvertisement said we should visit it after the show, it was closed and no explanations were given. In conclusion, the addvertisement promised this would be a perfect evening out, but it was not, so I would like to ask for my money back. I would like to hear from you in the near future. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Pat wasn't good at keeping secrets Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. I all happened a year ago, when Pat and I were still best friends and used to tell each other everything. One day, I inocently told Pat that I was dating Philip Smythe, the school's hunk and most popular boy. I asked Pat not to tell anyone, and she promised me she wouldn't. I believed in her and trusted her blindly. I went home that day after having told Pat my deepest secret with a weird feeling in my heart. Something was telling me that I was going to lose a friend and a love. The next day, I went to school and found out that Pat had told everybody that I was dating Philip. Suddenly, an enourmous saddness caught me, because Philip had begged me not to tell anyone, so he would definately brake up with me, and I knew I was going to stop talking to Pat, because she had just ruined my happiness and I couldn't trust her anymore. Now, unfortunately, I don't have a boyfriend or a best friend, all because Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. ",39.0
257," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to complain about the musical show ""OVER THE RAINBOW"" which I saw in your theatre  the 5th of June. I have been very disappointed by the quality of the show and the lies in your advertisement. Firstly, I was looking forward to seeing Danny Brook, as written in the advertisement, but his part was played by another actor, without  information or excuse  from the direction. Secondly, I coudn't get a discount with my student card and the show started 45 minutes later. In addition, the theatre restaurant, where we had planned to eat, was closed because the cook was ill. I am therefore asking for a complete refund of my ticket and I hope you will improve the quality of your services in the future. Yours faithfully H. Coulez  [SEP]  Unfortunatly, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. The poor boy was only 5 year old and at this age, it's very difficult to keep your mouth shut knowing an important secret. So when he heard at random that my parents were planning to offer me a trip to San Fansisco as  present for my birthday, my little brother ran in my bedroom wherever I was studying and whispered in my ear the wonderful news. I knew they wanted to send me to America because they didn't want me to spend the summer with my boyfriend Fred, whom they didn't appreciate. But Fred booked a place on a plane to San Fransisco and that's why, even if I didn't look delighted when my mum gave me my ticket for America, I had been looking forward to going with Fred for already one month.

354," SOLES LEDIA CI HACIA DE LOREDES MADRID THE CIRCLE THEATRE LONDON Dear Sir, I am writing  you to complain about the musical show which took place the last 1st of May in ""the Circle Theatre"" in London. Your show was supposed to be one of the best that I had ever seen. At first sight the theatre was gorgeous, I was surprised of its facade and also I was anxious for the beginning of the performance. My friends and me thought that it would be the perfect night  in London but everything changed when the show had been delayed more than forty-five minutes. Although we had problems at the entrance with the tickets, we looked forward for that marvellous night. The prices that our travel agency confirmed  us were not the same as the  theatre, we asked for our special discount for be students with less than eighteen years but we only obtained a rudely answer of the woman who sold the tickets. In addition to this, we realized when the show began that the main character was not Danny Brook. At top of everything the restaurant was closed and we could not eat on the theatre. You can imagine how upset we were and we asked you for our  reward for the night that we spent . Yours Faithful  [SEP]  Nowadays we think in the modern technology as something usual in our lives. For instances with the arrive of  Internet, the new digital television or the researchers in the medecin; we are discovering how we can change our lives only with  press  a botton, or look for something new with only think about it... we realize that the new technology it have just begun , and  lively in a few years we will be very avanced in this way. In my point of view the new techincs have more advantages than disadvantages, my reasons for saying that is because furthermore we can live better, we can also have more ways of know now to live healthy and how to spent our free time. Although the technology also is used for create new types of weapons and also for killing people, it is only the worst part of this. But however it is a good idea to spend out money in make new enterprises which pay the researchers and they could investigate how  to improve ourselves. ",25.0
278," Dear Sir/madam I am writing with regard to your advertisment. During my 2 week's holiday I would like to attend a musical show. It was my favorite play. I was very hopefull that I was going to have a good time. But there were many things which went wrong. Firstly, I have had no discount at paying. secondly there was  delay which got me into trouble, After the show I couldn't catch my train. Because I didn't have any plan I decided to have a lunch in  theatre restaurant. But it was closed. The worst thing is that I couldn't watch my favorite actor. I was so dissapointted with that. I couldn't consentrate on the play any more. Contrary to the advertisment everything was disapointing. I regret  to demand all my expenses . I hope you are going to be take into consideration my terrible situation. I am waiting for a satisfactory answer Yours faithfully Azami  [SEP]  Technology has developed increasingly in recent years. As a result of this our society has changed a lot. On the one hand technology has made our lives more comfortable and easier. On the other hand we have faced some problems, such as social and environmental problems. Nowadays students have much more facilitis in education than before. Although in those days the only way of learning was reading. These days we can use  computer, television and some sophisticated equipment. which were unusuall before. Than to technology we can reach any place in the world easily. We can get some information more quickly. Technology has a huge effect on our spare time activities as well. Children play wit computer instead of  usuall plays. Despite the huge facilities technology has affected our lives negatively. There has been  change  relatinships between people. People are getting more and more lonely. We have noticed the environmential damage in recent years. While we are using technology, we should take into consideration  environment. We shouldn't allow to be exploited the world. If we want to leave a good world to the next generations, we should behave more respectfully againgst the nature. ",27.0

We have thought that The London Fashion and Leisure Show would be a great opportunity to give us more information about the main transformation in nowdays in England about fashions, Leisure, sports and style of life.

This sad and unlucky day was on Friday 1998,  it wasn't 13th even it look liked , but it was my 25th birthday. Everything was going so bad and I knew, I could die. Unfortunately, I've got a brother who likes to live in  dangerous and poor way and I don't know how, but he could persuade me to go with him to get some drugs, in my 25th birthday. I was at home making me up before to go to a restaurant with my friends and, sudenlly, he rang the bell, he was so nervous with a gun in his hands and no longer I could speak he took me out with him. I had tried to think in stopping him, but he was stronger than me and he had used all his power to scared me and he forced me to buy cocain using my cheques. I didn't want ,  I've never approve  his deal with the drug, but I couldn't do it different. The dangerous man who we'd gone to buy drugs  was upset with my brother and had decided to kill him, but I had killed him first. If I didn't do it, I knew I would die, my option was my life, but now I haven't any chance to live because I'm in the prison. ",22.00

I would like to travel on July because this is the only month  given to me by my employer.

Yours faithfully Pablo Fernandez  [SEP]  Many classes and activities are important in our school But I have to make a choice in order to select  them The class of mecanics seem to be the more important lesson. It use a lot of technics that we learn in other classes. It gives us the knowledge  usefull for many school club like the ""marathon shell"" club or the robotich club. Besides it gives all the areas covered by a mecanic ingenier and it is very important in a school where you will probably become a mecanic ingenier It lets us specify our abilities in the part of mecanics that we prefer. But there are other lessons very important (like English of course!) Actually, I have a regret, there is no ethic lessons, It would show us how use our knowledge. ",23.0

106," Dear Mr/Mss I'm writing  you in complain about  musical show, that I have visited last evening. I had a week holiday in London, so I wanted to spend my last evening with great pleasure, however it was the worse evening in my life. First of all, the actors were different from those who were advertised. Second, the show started at 20:15, althoug I read that it started at 19:30! More over after watching a show I wanted to visit your theatre restaurant, but it was closed, it really disappointed me. It was my dream to see Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, so it is still my dream because of your show. So, I had no perfect evening out and I want my money back. I hope you'll understand my situation and if you want other people to visit your show, you should return my money. Yours faithfuly  [SEP]  How has modern techology changed my daily life. Fifty years ago people even didn't think that after 2000 years they would have another life. When Thomas Adison invented an electric light, it was the greatest invention for people of that centure. And nowadays modern technology can change all our life. I mean, almost everyone has now a car, a computer, a mobil phone and even an airplane. My life is changing too. First of all now I can phone my friends and parents from every place, I can chat with other foreign teenagers with the help of the internet. Second modern technology helps me in the kitchen. Coocking became faster with the help of the microwave. What is more Modern technology prevents different illnesses. Further more, yesterday I've heard that every man could fly to the space without any experience, it is great, from my point of view  in 2050  year everybody will fly to the space. On the other hand people can atrophided of all this inventions. He become lazy because they know that they can seat on the sofa and turn the chances on the TV by pressing a boton. In conclusion I want to say that inspite of this, I hope that in future we will have more and more new inventions and they will stop our disasters and problems. ",29.0
1018," Dear Mr Robertson, I'm writing to you on the name of all the students who will go to the London's trip. First of all thank you very much for your programme, it's sounds very interesting and everybody is looking forward to it.  However, we do all have a request to ask you. We saw an advertisement about the ""London Fashion and Leisure Show"" in the Central Exhibition Hall in London. This show is going on all day on March 14th. As teenagers we're all very keen on fashion so it will be a great opportunity to go because in our countryside, we'll never get a chance to see a show like that. What we are suggesting you is to change the programme on the afternoon of March the 14th. Instead of going shopping, we could go to the show. Anyway, as students we don't have much money to spend on shopping and the good thing is that it won't affect your budget at all as the entrance fees are free for students. We hope you consider our request which would be very appreciate in the class. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Why  medias are so interesting in famous people? Because of us! I know that everyone is excited about what happened to Michael Douglas' wedding or what kind of life the President of The United States is living but sometimes it's going a bit to far. Those movie stars or politicians may have a lot of money, may do whatever they want but what is the price to pay? Would you like to live a life like that, every time you make a wrong step, the whole world is looking at you, judging you. It must be very exhausted to have the medias around you days and nights because you can't be yourself, you have to show your best side and character. In my opinion it should be a rule which let the medias approach famous people almost anywhere except in their private home to leave them at least one place to feel safe. ",27.00
512," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to complain about the musical show. Over the Rainbow, which you advertised. I saw the show at your theatre with my friend on 6th June. However, I was disappointed with something which did not match your advertisement. First of all, I would like to have seen Danny Brook as I am keen on his play. He did not play in the evening. It made me sad. Secondly, the starting time has been changed from 19:30 to 20:15. We waited for ages because we had not been informed. In addition, although you advertised the discounts tickets  available, they do not sale them any more according to your staff. Finally, we went to the restaurant in your theater after the show. It was closed because of the staff trainning. I am sure you can understand my disappointment. I must insist that you refund the cost of the show. Unless I hear from you within ten days, I shall have to take legal advice on the matter. I look forward to hearing from you in the near future. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  It is believed that our life style has been changed by mordern technology such as computers and washing machine etc. Especially for families. I have found  very expensive to buy them but there are  number of advantages. First of all, dishwashers are very effecient for me because I work full time and look after my children. It is very difficult to cook and wash dishes after working. Before buying my dishwasher I asked my son to wash them. He complained about  a lot. Secondly, computers are useful for us as well, because we do not need to go somewhere if we want to have information, for example  traveling. However my family's members do less communicate with each other than we used to, because my children are keen on playing computer games. In my opinion, the morden technology make our life style combinient. It is very good for us but I think we should think about more carefully when we buy something for our children. ",34.0
108," Santiago, June 17th, 200 Dear Sir, I am writting this letter because I am very dissapointed with your musical show. I recently went to London on vacation, with some friends. We were told that this was a great show, and we decided to see how it was. If the show was as good as we were told we should save our final night for it, this was going to be the end of our vacation, a great one by the way. When our final day arrived, we went shoping in the morning and then we went to the hotel to change our clothes and get ready for the show. When we arrived, the were a lot of people, the pace was beatiful, all seemed perfect. When we entrance the place our problems begun. First, there were no discount on the tickets but that was fine. Then, the show had a great delay, almost an hour, we deal with that too. After that they changed the principal actor, the one that replaced him was very bad, that made us realy angry. But that isn't all, to complete this tragedy the restaurant was closed. I hope that you understand that I want my money back, or at least some of it, because this weren't my ""perfect evening out""  [SEP]  How has moden technology changed my daily life? I think that technology have change my life and everybodies life in many ways. Nowadays, technology is everywhere, all over your house, your school, ofice or any place you can be in a city. This technology has help to made my life easier and more exciting, but like everithing   had some negative thing. This technology has help in many fields, like medicine, entreteinment, work and other thing, so it has obviusly change the life of many people. The bad things that this could have are unimportan, in comperison with all the good things this have done, so let's don't focus on the negative aspects of it. I think technology has become a part of our lifes, so we have to learn how to live in this new world, that is changing as fast as computers change. This is a new era, an era for a new tipe of people, the feuta people ",32.0
650," Dear Helen Ryan, I have just received your letter where you inform me I have won the first prize in the competition and now, I'd like to express my opinion about the questions you have written on it. First of all, I would like to travel only in the month of July, because during the month of June, I'm going to work and in September I have to study a lot, because school will start . Speaking about accommodation, between tents and log cabins, I woul prefer  tents, because I love the adventure and also because I can be freer. I know I will have the chance to do two activities, so I have choosen two from your list: Basketball, because I have been playing it since I was eight and I have been taking part in a strong team for three years. The other one I have choosen is swimming; for the same reason why I chose Basketball. But, what about clothes, money, food? I hope you will take my answers into consideration. Thank you for now. Yours faithfuly Simone Pausini  [SEP]  Many people ""see"" at shopping like an amusement, but I think it's not always a good translation to give it. In my opinion to do shopping is often funny, above all when you can enter without difficulties into a shop. For exemple, if the shop is full of people,  is not enjoyable, because they will create too  confusion, too  noise with the risk of leaving time. Shopping is a funny thing to do, not when you are in a hurry, but when you have  free time and when you can relax yourself. Another thing that regardes  me, is that I enjoy my self more when I know I have to do shopping for me than when it's for my parents or for somebody else!!! ",24.0
1183," Dear Mrs M. Smith, I am writing in order to reply to your letter and to give you all the information that you requested. First of all the hotel is the Palace Hotel, 82 Regent Street, so that it is very easy to reach the conference. In fact you can take the bus number 3; as you can see, the bus stop is just in front of the hotel, then you can get off immediately after the church that you pass, on your right hand. Secondly, we will have the party in the hotel at 8.00 o'clock and a buffet will be served at 8.30 p.m. It would be also possible to get some vegetarian food and drink cocktails free of charge. I would recommend your students to bring their Identity Card to prove their age. What is more, I would suggest to wear very smart dress and for men it is oblidged the tie. Finally, if I were you I would go shopping to the City Centre to spend your last hours. However, if you re interested in Archeology you should vitis the History Museum in Garden Square. I hope you will find my letter of interest and I look forward to seeing you. Yours Sincerely,  [SEP]  Have you ever thought  to live without your car? How can you manage your daily life without it? I the last fourty years people seem to be completely addicted by using their own car. It is said that the majority of the citizens has got a car and unfortunately this is the reason why cities are getting more polluted. On the other hand, this kind of facility has made our life more comfortable and easy. In fact we can go everywhere sitting either with friends or with our family and carring  lugguage and shopping bags. Cars are able to cover not only short distance but also can be used for long journey. For example, in the past it would had been extremely exhausting travelling riding a hourse but nowadays we have lots of big and spacious cars and a wide range of optionals to choose with. However, I have to say that it has made people be lazy and at the same time stressed due to the traffic. On the other hand one of the main advantages is that we can save time and money as cars have long last and allowe us travelling quickly. That's why I couldn't image my life without it. ",31.00
815," 13 of June, 2000 Dear Helen I am really happy to receive  letter about Camp California from you. I am exciting and looking forward to doing camp there. I would like to travel in July because I have an important exam in September. Plus, it may be lovely weather at that time in  U.S.A. I would prefer log cabins. To tell the truth, I want to stay in both, but I have never stayed in log cabins before, so I would try  new style for me! I would like to choose singing and tennis. I used to go to KARAOKE with my meats in Japan as I really like to do that, anytime. On the other hand, I have played tennis for nearly 7 years and it is also one of my hobbies. If possible, could you please let me know information about the way of getting there, e.g. airport information?? Thank you very much. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Kim Hello, Kim! It's been ages to write letters to you. How was your exam? I believe it went well! By the way, last month I was in that pop concert which you mentioned in your last letters. Can you believe it? Actually I helped and support to sell tickets at the reception. I've sold tickets before but not in that kind of big pop concert. Before it was packed into by  audience, we had to clean around the reception, but totally it was really exciting although I was just a  staff in the small reception, because I felt great excitement (especially girls!) from people queing. I liked that especially. I don't like to tidy up, you know!! I like to face people whom even I don't know. Foremost, after finishing my work, I could meet singers by chance!! That night was brilliant and class! I keep that in my mind,  ever! Anyway, hope to hear from you shortly. See you. Love From ",24.0
120," Dear Manager A few days ago I went to the Circle theatre to see a musical show which it shows in your theatre now. Also it made me very disappoint. There are several reasons that I was not happy about the musical. The first one I am going to complaint about is the actor. I could not see Danny Brook during the show. There was an different actor instead of him. Secondly, the times, it's available  14.30 and 19.30 so I choose 19.30. However it was deleied  it started  20.15. Also I had a student identification card to discount the ticket price but it was unavilable to discount. The theatre restaurant was closed after the show, they said funds are runn out. Those are totally unexpectable so I presume that I would like to get paid for my ticket cost. I ask you to transfor money into this account. Barclays bank 1010-10 1234567 Jon Sun. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed your daily life? First of all it's difficult say what exactly modern technology is now but I can say for sure it's keep developing and much better than the past. Think about the conputer, the speed of conputer is much faster than before. I even couldn't imagine our p.c can be that fast. Also T.Vs, I guess that I was not able to watch colour T.V if I was born in 1960. T.V colour only consist of white and black. Nowdays the technology is keep develop and the better technology gives us  easier life. Another example, the internet. This is  revolution which has changed our daily life. You can have a shopping on the internet and it might  the fastest way to gather any information you would like to search. However it also can make our life very lazy. This is one other important thing to remember. People who have their  car, they don't attempt to walk on foot even if it is  short distance. The improvement of technology can makes our life easy and in the other way it also can makes our life lazy. ",23.0
250," Dear Sir I had been to London recently for a week's holiday and I have been to a musical show in the Circle Theatre. When I saw the advertisement about the show I got very excited, because I always wanted to see ""Over the Rainbow"", but I had some problems, and I want you to know about that. First of all, when I bought the tickets I had no discount, and in the advertisement it was mentioned that people would have some, and when I got in the theatre to see the play, I had to wait for almost an hour until the show begun. Then, I got very disappointed because the actors in the play were not those ones mentioned in the advertisement. There were unknown actors, and they were not as good as the other ones. Afterwards, I was expecting to have at least a nice dinner in the theatre restaurant, but it was already closed because the show ended too late. I had had not a perfect night at all, so I would like to ask if I can have my money back. Please give me an answer. Thank you for reading this letter. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  We cannot deny that technology has changed our lives. Nowadays, we do not need anymore to spend hours cooking, for example: we just put some frozen food in the microwave, and in a few minutes our meal is ready. We can communicate with people in distant countries in real time, using the internet. There is a lot of other examples of how technology has changed people's lives. I would not do my school projects without using a computer, because I have to do some statistical analysis that I would not do with a calculator. Also, I can communicate with some friends who live in other countries by e-mail almost every day, and I save some money because I pay for a local call, and not for an international call. An other thing which is very useful for me is my mobile phone, because people can talk to me whenever they need , but on the other hand it is very unpleasant to be interrupted by the phone when I am in an important meeting.

245," Dear Manager: When I first heard about Over the Rainbow I was very exited about the idea of seeing it, plus when I heard about the facilities that the circle theatre was giving, it becomed the best oportunity I ever had to asist to a musical of that category, but instead of being the best evening I ever had, it was a total disaster and that's the reason why I am writting to you. Like I have already told you, instead of being the perfect evening, it was the worst I ever had. First, the actors that the Circle theatre publis in their tickets for Over the Rainbow were not , which was very disappointing because, the actors were starring  the musical, was one of it mayor attractions. Another point that I want to comply about, is the time that the musical was supposed to start (19:30) but it started at 20:15, so there was a mayor unsatisfaction about it, but the last and worst thing was that your theatre restaurant was closed because the British health institute considered that your food was unhealthy, and  not considering many other points like unsatisfactory service, and uncomfortable seats. In consequence of the reasons I have already explained, I would like to ask you if I can have my money back, but this is not the most important  to me, because I want your theatre to change and become the best. Hope to hear from you:  [SEP]  Science and Technology is a theme very  discussed nowdays, most of the comunity of our city, and of the world, were technology has arrived, confirms that it has in some way improved their way of life. And I think it's the same to me, because when advances in technology like computers, internet, etc. were made, it changed my life as a high school student. Answering the question: ""How has modern technology changed my daily life?, I can confirm, that it has been in many ways, and the most important one that I can remember was the invention of computers and later the internet, because it was easiest to me, and to every one, to make your home works, school works, and in fact, it was easier to me to search for information that in the past I would have to look at in a library. But not all about technology and computers is good, because many people, and me in a control way, had become computer's an thechnologic's slaves, and we can not do anything without a machine, and I am not saying that it's wrong or bad, and I accept that they make easier our daily tasks, but we have to mantain our independence as humans. Technology, in fact it has made an improvement on daily tasks, but we have to think and work by ourselves because if not our brain will become atrophied. ",23.0
821," Dear Helen Ryan. I'm very pleased to hearing from you, and I'm glad I've got this chance to go to the Camp California in the U.S.A. for two weeks. Firstly I must say that I'll be able to have two weeks free only in July, since I started work and  intitled to have a holiday only in July. Secondly, I'd prefer to accommodate myself in one of the log cabins, as they are more comfortable, usually have central heating and other necessary facilities. Despite my appriciation of all kinds of sports and activities, I'd choose my favourite ones, which are swimming and tennis. As I was a champion of  swimming competition in Russia in 1997, I'd like to continue to practice my skills. Also I like to play tennis, which is  beautiful ""game"" itself and good for  figure. In the conclusion I would like to ask if I need to take some money with me and how much? What kind of clothes will I need in the U.S.A. in July? Probably summer clothes mostly? Your sincerely, Hope to hear from you soon.  [SEP]  ""Is shopping always enjoyable for you or not"" - my English teacher has asked me on the class discussion about shopping. Sincerely, I must admit, that I don't like shopping in supermarkets and big stores. There are always too many people there. As I'm not keen of being a part of the crowd, I prefer a calm atmosphere in more isolated small shops. Furthermore, it takes too long to find something you need in unfamiliar stores. Despite  I like to go to nice clothes shops I usually return home with nothing in my hands, as prices are usually to high, unfortunately not affordable for me. Sometimes I go to the local market, but not on my own. I ask my husband or mother to come with me, as I had  bad experience in the past, when my bag with all my money was stolen. Another thing I dislike about shopping is some annoying shop assisstants which try to sale any products to the ""victim"" entring the door. Otherwise shopping is not so bad, as you get what you want in the end. ",32.0
504," Dear Sir: I am writing to let you know  the disappointed evening I had seen your show with the worst services I have ever seen. First of all, in the ticket for entrance  says that the actor was Danny Brook and realy he was not. In the show apears a different actor, so I was very disappointed. Then, in the ticket  says that the show started at 19.30 and, I don't know why, it started at 20:15, very unpolited of your side, and also,  make me lose time. Other thing is that in the ticket  apears that discounts were available but when I asked for it, there was no one. The last thing is that you invited us to visit your restaurant after the show, but it was closed because the food was not already done. I thought you were a good theatre, were people can go and have a good evening alone or with somebody else, but realy I am very disappointed and I want to ask for my money back. I'll never return again because of the bad service you ofer. Please, let me know your answer. Truely.  [SEP]  All of us know the technology and science has affected our lives. Seen my hole life I can say the moden technology has changed my daily life in many ways. The first way is that it has changed my family's relationship. It has, in some way, separated the family's life, making all of us be worried about ower own things. We work all separated, making grow the individuality and forgoten we has to talk all together to know about the other's life. The second way is that it has make easy my life. The comunications in the world are faster than ever, so when I need something, I can have it in only a minute. It allowed me to worry about other things of the life. The last way in that the technology has allowed me to have a better health. It has descover many instruments that help me to have a good health. To finish, I can say technology has changed my life in good and bad ways, helping the things be easier but making me develop a big independence. ",20.0
563," Dear Helen Ryan, I recived your letter and I'm very happy because I didn't expect it, so first of all I want you know that I really fancy going at Camp California in the U.S.A during two weeks, and specially because I've never been in this country. On one hand I would like to travel in July because I'm working in a school and the lessons finish at the end of June so if I could go to this extraordinary opportunity in July it would be better for me because in August I will have to be ready to begin preparing the exams of september. If it is any problem let me know as soon as possible because I'll try to sort it out. On the other hand I think I would rather not sleep in a tent because I had a bad experience once and I would like to try log cabins. although it wouldn't be a problem if I finally have to sleep in a tent. Another point is that I have already chose two activities that you asked me while I am at the camp and  are basketball and golf, they are the best  for me because I think I am good at both and I used to play them before. Finally I want to find out about if  is any supermarket near the camping and if there are any facilities in washing my clotches into the camp. I look forward to reciving a reply from you.  [SEP]  Dear Kim, Last month I had the most exciting experience in my life, as you know I was helping at the pop concert and it was amazing! The concert was in the University in the middle of the field and at the begining when we arrived there weren't many people, only those who had to prepare the stage and the sound  and of course us who had the job of serving drinks during the concert. We arrived quite soon because we had to organise how we went to serve people did with which order, so we started putting all the stuff in  appropiate place. I was very nervous because I'd never been in a concert before and an hour before everything stated the singer and the musicians were there and I couldn't avoid it and I started crying - you can imagine, they were so handsome that I couldn't belive it - I tried to calm down because I had to work, and later I began feeling more comfortable and when the concert started everything was such exciting that the time ran very fast - although I was working - and it was like a dream. Well I think I'm going to remember it all my life and I'm sure that if you had been there you would have enjoyed  very much. See you soon. Best wishes. ",26.0

I like to travel only  July becouse now I'm studying at National Academy of Defense and I don't have a time for enything else. When I will arrive. I would prefer accommodation in Log cabins. I prefer that becouse I will travel with my wife and she always prefers that kind of accommodation. I tell you in sicryt that, I don't know whay she do that. You said that I will have the chance to do two activities, sou I choose swimming and sailing. I Love all kind of water sports. In summer I always goes to  seaside or some kind of lake to swim. I like to catch fisch too. I think that I'm good at swimming. When I was young I had been swimm in many competition. My live record is 27.66 for fivety meters. I would like to ask you about  weather at California's  Julay. What kind of clothes I should bring with me. Are there any discoteks or something I would like to know if my wife can come with me, becouse withou't she I can't be there.

Everybody gets up at six, and  first things they do it is run for about two thousends five houndred meters. Then they take a schower and everybody goes for breakfast. Usually I have eight lessons. Two times a week I have W-F. This is very important, becouse every soldier schould be strong. Today there was the sport competition in Basketball. My group of students won that competition for  second time. I'm not playing basketball well, but my friends do. After this competition there was a mathematic, and two houers of biology. I don't like biology, sow I sleept on the desk in a class-room. I think that competitions should be filmed becouse my school is a kind of sport's school. On video there schould be howe we get's up. Houe we run, houe we eat breakfast. Then you should schow houe ouer school looks from outside. There schould be an intereview witch students and with profesons. Daily life at my school that is not only school and teachers and mathematicas problems. There is a military problems too. We spends a lot of time outside the school during the military things.

163," Dear Mister I'm writing to you to complain about the musical show you present at the moment: ""Over the Rainbow"". As my husband is a native and we live in Switzerland, we apreciate to pass a week in London every year. We are keen on theatre and musical show. Your theatre is known to present excellent spectacles. We were never disappointed so far and especially enjoyed ""The Drama"" you presented last year. Anyway we had a very disappointing evening. At first, we couldn't get any discount, although you mention it on your advertisment. And the only tickets left were at £20. Then the spectacle began 45 minutes later than mentioned. Last but not least, Danny Brook was replaced by a different actor, whose name I probably forgot because of his poor performance. Afterwards we are used to eat at your restaurant which is not only well known for it's good price value but also for it's original decoration. Therefore I ask you to give use £20 back, because the two tickets were not more worth. I'm looking forward to hearing soon from you. yours faithfully  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't really good at keeping secrets. The following story will prove it. I left the office at six o'clock. I was free as the air. My husband was following a course all the week in Berne. The kids were by their grandmother, who take care of them. I drove to Ouchy where I took a drink. It was so hot, I decided to go for a swim in tutry, although I hadn't any swimming-clothes. I knew a good place. I parked the car and went ten minuts. As I had planed, the place was deserted. I took my clothes of and swam  twenty minutes in the lake. Coming back, I noticed that my clothes were missing. I walked back, hoping I wouldn't come accross anyone and be able to drive back home. The car was missing too. Unfortunately a police car drove by and the policeman saw me standing there nude. They drove me to their office after having given me use of their shirt. There I called Pat who picked me up. I felt so miserable that Pat laughed seeing me. Of course she told everything to my husband. If only Pat could keep secrets! ",30.0
328," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to give my opinion about the musical show called ""Over the Rainbow"". I recently had a week's holiday in London and during my stay, I went to the Circle Theatre to see ""Over the Rainbow"". To tell the truth, it was a very disappointing evening. When I read the advertisement first, I thought that it would be fun. In the advertisement, it was written that the show was London's newest and best musical show. Well, it might be the newest one but certainly, it was not the best one. I thought that the actor of the show was Danny Brook, but he was not playing in the show. The actor was somebody else and this was something disappointing. The show should have started at 19:30 but, it started at 20:15. Which means, I had to wait there for 45 minutes. And also, it was written that the discounts were available but they were not. After the show, I decided to visit the theatre restaurant but it was closed. On the door, there was a note saying that the restaurant was closed because of the illness of the cook. I had given £20 and now, I would be pleased if you give some of my money back. It was a terrible evening out for me. I hope the next musical show would be a better one. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  MODERN TECHNOLOGY In the past, everything was very different. People had completely different life-styles. People were using candles to see around them. In winter, they used to fire some woods to keep warm, ""Computer"" was a word that nobody had known the meaning of it. As my mum told me, when she was young, only a few people had televisions in their houses. And of course, they were black-and white. Their hobies were listening to the radio, reading books or sitting on a chair without doing anything. Modern technology has changed our daily life a lot. We are using mobile phones so it doesn't matter if we are in a crowded city or on a desert. You can communicate with other people any time you want. Nearly 90 per cent of people know how to use a computer and computers are used in every section of our lives. We also have  ""internet"", by which you can learn something about the world in less than a minute. Modern technology is very important for all the countries. It has a very big role in developing a country. When you look around, you can easily understand that modern technology is used in everything. I think, we are all very lucky people that we aren't using candles or black and white televisions anymore? ",32.0

Some people can live without this, but I am sure that the world would be very different. When we are using different equipments in our houses, we are using the electricity. Small things but very importants in our lifes. For example: T.V., computer, just light and a long list that now I can not write. I don't like tinking , my house of my life, without all this facilities. In winter when  is dark very early, and after, I need to spent my free time in home. What I can do without my music and my computer. Now, just you need to think that you would do or what would happen in a city, with a car, aeroplans, shoops, all these things without lights. Finally. I think that everybody know that the electricity is  very important invent and for me it is the best. ",17.00
109," 17, June 2000 The manager The Circle Theatre Sir, I returned very unhappy from my holidays. The reason is that the musical show that I had seen with my wife, first of all, started late. We bought tickets for the second show, that was at 19.30 and it started at 20:15! We were interested on see the actors that appeard on the tickets and I was very disappointed when, in the show, we saw another actors. The tickets were more expensive than we had expected, but we didn't care because we saw in the tickets that  will be discounts for it, but, they didn't make us discounts! With all this problems, the only thing that led us, was  to eat something. When the show finished we went to the theatre restaurant and it was closed because people didn't arrived to work that day. So it was the most badly evening that I had ever spend. I asked you to consider all my reasons and turned back my money, I think  is the only thing you can do. Thank you for your comprehension  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. It was saturday night, and I was, with my sister Pat alone in my home. That night I was invited to a great party, but I was punished, and I had to stayed at home with my sister. My parents were out for the weekend. When it was time to go to the party I decided to escape home without telling my sister, unfortunately when I arrived she was waiting  me in my room. When I enter my room she was very happy, because my father will punished me again, of course, she will tell him, but I decided to pay her if she beheaved quietly, she accepted and I payed her a lot of money. At sunday night, when my parents arrived, they asked her if I had stayed at home on saturday, my sister beheave silence for a minute and then started laughing; so my parents, with her laugh, know that I had go out that Saturday; and punished me for a year.

But, Yes. First the starring was going to be Danny Brook, but then another man took his place, I couldn't believe it, you couldn't change Danny Brook, a very important artist, and put a begginer one . It was very disappointing. Secondly, It was supposed to start at 19:30 and it started at 20:15. Yes, 45 minutes, I want to see you in that case. What would you do? I felt like a dumb, and all the people felt like me. And well, don't talk about the discounts, because they didn't exist. More than that, the restaurant was closed because it was on repairing. At end, I could see that the advertisement said ""Your perfect evening out"", it wasn't the perfect evening, now I'm looking for a layer, because I want my money back, if don't well you know the end of this story. Faithfully  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, because one day when Maria, her sister, was walking to the school, a car stopped at her and a man said ""I know who is your love, it's Peter"". Maria passed all the day thinking about who told them that, there were two posibilities: one her best friend Becca or his sister Pat. But the problem began to increase because all her friends knew her secret. It was like a ""chain reaction"", until Maria didn't want to go to school any more, her mother talked to her, but there was no case, she was very angry and hurt. One day, at his house, she listened  Pat talking with a friend and Maria realised that Pat said everything, because they were talking about a secret of another friend. But there was a problem, how to said it to Pat, in a good or in a bad way, she decided for the good one. Obviously, Pat first refused , but then she accepted that she was wrong, and apologyse  Maria, after then Pat never again talked about someone within his or her permission. The End. ",21.0
569," 13th June 2000 Dear Sir, I have just receised your letter and I thanck you for your invitation and congratulations. I am really proud to be the winner of your competition and I would like to express my satisfaction for your perfect organisation. About the information requested from me I have to say that I can travel only  July because of my job; I am busy until the end of June. As regards accomodation, I prefer a longer, Canadian tent in a quiet place because I am fond of nature and I would like to feel free in an informal setting. My favourite sports-activities are playing tennis and basketball. I like competitive and changelling sports, I enjoy myself comparing my skill with other players and, if possible, I  rather practising sports-activities not indoor, but open air . I would like to know if special clothes are needed and how the weather is in this period like. The one last thing that I would like to know is if I have to bring with me money for expenses not included in your invitation. Let me know this information as soon as possible. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely Ramona  [SEP]   13 June 2000 I have been asked to write a report about the lessons and other activities that should be filmed to make a short video. I have given a questionnaire to other students of my class to know their preferences about this choise and we all believe that the first lesson that should be filmed is Philosophy. The reason is that all students are interested in it and the teacher is so good in explaing problems that the whole class takes part in discussions about specific aspects of the subject. Also the sports-activities should be filmed; they express an aggregative and social way of living school-life and can be useful to see and check out the moviments of the bodys during the atletics-school games. Also the dancing lessons should be filmed, specially for the fascinating beauty of the girls and the elegance of their moviments. I hope that these my suggestions can be accepted and appreciated.

1075," Dear Mr Robertson, I am writing with reference to the three day trip in London. Thank you very much for organising the programme, which seems extremely interesting. Especially,  sightseeing by bus must be enjoyable. However, my classmates and I also found another fascinating thing about the trip. It is 'The London Fashion and Leisure Show' at  Central Exhibition Hall in London on  14th of March, which shows the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles. We all found it exciting and exhilarating. It must be a great opportunity to see the show because we are keen on fashions and clothes. In addition, students can go without paying any fees. Therefore, I wonder if we could possibly change the programme slightly on 14th March. We would like to see the show on Tuesday afternoon, instead of shopping. We can go shopping on Wednesday afternoon at the free time. I would be grateful, if you could understand our concern and change the programme on 14th of March. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Famous people, such as politicians and film stars, are always followed by journalists. Do they have to give up their private lives? First of all, I think they should accept the fact that they are well-known and they should be observed all the time, as we are curious to know what they do and we love to gossip about others. Moreover, it might be a good thing that scandales usually increase their fame, even if they did anything wrong. On the other hand, it is also said that their private lives must not be intruded , as they are the same as us, human beings. It does not seem possible that we can live without any private life. To sum up, although I think they ought to abondone their lives partly when they entre the world of fame, they should take some actions against journalists in order to protect their human rights.

950," Dear Ms Ryan, I was enthusiatic about receiving your letter. I will give you all the necessary information. I would like to travel in July because during that period I will be free from work, my current post finishes at the end of June but I will start another job at the beginning of August. I would prefer to stay in  tents rather than in  log cabins, because it would be a new experience for me and I would like to try something different. As far as the activities are concerned, I have chosen to do Tennis and Swimming. I am good at playing Tennis and I have been learning to swim for three months so it could be a useful training for me. Moreover I would like to know what kind of clothes are the best for living in the camp and if I need to bring with me a large amount of money. I want to thank you for this prize, let me know if you need further information. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely, Bianca Botticelli  [SEP]  Dear Kim, In your last letter you asked me about the concert... oh it was fantastic! I've always loved music so working in a concert was great. You can't imagine how many people are involved in the organization of a concert, apart from the musicists and the singers, there are people who work with lights, who organize the security service... it was so exciting! My work consisted in checking the tickets,  the number on them and taking the people to their seats. It was also very tiring because all the people arrived at the same time and they didn't want to wait for my help; so they went around the theatre, looking for their seats and making so much noise. Sometimes I think that people never grow up, if they had been a class of children, they would have made less noise!! Anyway, it was a great experience in spite of these little problems. Now I have to go, write soon and let me know what you have been doing. Lots of love Bianca xxx ",36.0
154," Dear Sir/Madam I am writting  you for complaining about the last saturday evening performance in your theatre. I was very disappointed! First of all, the principal character was not Danny Brook, but a substitute, and the theatre had not notified the audience about this changing before . Secondly, the show started 45 minutes late. We would not have had  discounts on  price and any worker wanted to give us an explanation for that. After the show, we decided to go to the restaurant to dinner, but it was closed for work. Everything was completely different from what you had announced on the advertisement I am sure you understand why I am so upset and you will do your best to give me satisfaction, I mean, refunding me exactly what I had paid for this terrible evening. I look forward to hearing from you very soon. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Modern technology has changed my daily life, making it easy, with less effort and time spent  . A simple example, we can at the same time wash our clothes with a washing machine, record a tv program and talk to someone on the other side of the world. All this in one morning, and the day just begins, what  doing next? Technology allows  to have more time to distractions or to other things we really like to . We can take care of whom we love and give them more attention, time is not a really problem. We will see people differently, with more calm, because we have no stress and we are not in a hurry to do something else. We will be more comprehensible with others. It is the first step for a true fraternity. Of course, everything can not be completely perfect. All this modern technology increase the level of polluted products that can not be easily destructed. Living better, people live longer and it is necessary to product more food, but more food means chemical agents on  earth, the circle never stops. In conclusion, modern technology allows me to live better and to have more time to do what I really like, although I know, all this has a price. ",26.0
620," Dear Mrs Ryan, I have just received your letter and I am writing in response of your questions. I can travel only in july because  is the only month of this year that I will be available because I finish school in june so I will be very busy  and in August I start to study at the University, so july is the best month for me to travel. Accommodation for me is not  problem. I am very easy going and I will be satisfied wherever . But if I have to choose, I prefer sleep in tents, because when I travel I usually sleep in that kind of accommodation so, for me they seem very comfortable. I would like to do the following activities: - Tennis because  is my favourite sport and I enjoy playing it. I play tennis since I was a child and I have won some competitions in my town so I think I play very well. - Climbing because I have never climbed in my life and it is a dream for me to do that. I am a terrible climber but with a little bit of help I think I can enjoy the activity and have a good time  unforgettable. I wonder to know what kind of clothes I have to wear because I don't know how the weather is in  U.S.A. Also I would like to know how much money I have to bring to the trip. I am looking forward to hear from you as soon as possible. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Hello Kim: Thank you for your letter it was great to hear from you. Sorry but I haven't written  you because I've been very busy. Last month I helped at a pop concert, it was marvellous. I have a friend and she knows that I speak English so she offered to me work with an English singer so I said ""yes, of course"". But you can't imagine who was the singer, it was Sting, can you imagine? You know, he is my favourite singer. My job was very easy I had to help Sting in everything, for example if he wanted water, I had to give to him water, it was marvellous. He was very kind to me, we talked  many things and after the concert he invited all the team to have a dinner, yes I know what you're thinking, ""Dinner and Sting"" yes my friend it was the best thing  in my life. I understood everything he said and Sting said to me that I spoken very well English. The best thing was I spoke in English because I was forgetting it and I met my favourite singer. I hope my friend call me again to work  because I had a wonderful time and it was a great and unforgettable experience. I hope you are O.K. and write soon. Lots of Love P.D. I send you an autograph that Sting wrote for you. ",29.0
241," Dear, Sir/Madam I am Writing this letter to say my dissatisfaction of your entertament. Last week I was on holiday and I went to The Circle Theatre to see over the rainbow musical. I was really looking forward to seeing it, because I like musical and also I like Danny Brook. However, the reading actor was not him! Of course, I was so disappointed. The actor was not famous for his acting. Also the musical did not start on time, it was late thirty minuts. We just sat on the seat and nothing to do. I was going to a restaurant with my friends after the musical, but the musical finished at ten thirty. It was too late and we could not have a dinner. If the musical had started on time, we could have eaten in the restaurant. Fathermore, discounts was unavailable. Even though we had a student card. In the advertisement they said that tickets discounts  available. I think it  a bombastic. Anyway I was so unpleasement. It was not  marvellous evening. Could you back my money please? You have  responsoiblity for the audiences. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed your daily life? My life have been changed by technological improving. Nowadays. We have so many technological things. For instance, TV, computers, telephone, air-conditionings. These things are very convinience on the other hand, there  lots of disadvantage point. I have my own TV in my room and I enjoy watching TV everyday. However, I need balance. If I watch TV too much I might not speak to my family  often. It will lack of communication. In addition, it is difficult turn it off. I think I should cut down  watching TV. Sometimes it  waste of time. What about computers? It is very useful too. I am living in London, but my father lives in Taiwan and my mother lives in Tokyo. I sometimes want to hear their voice on the telephone. Unfourtunately it is not so cheap. If I use e-mail  much easier and cheaper. And I can send e-mail anytime. If I  addicted on  internet, it will be  problem. I do not want to spend much time with computers. In conclusion. people include me need balance. We must be good at using computers. ",25.0
499," Dear Sir, I believe that you must be the manager and I would like to point some complaints of mine about the play ""Over the Rainbow""  Firstly, in the advertisement you said that Dany Brook was going to be starring in the play, but you've placed another actor in his place, which was very disappointing. Moreover, the theatre's play was expected to start at half past seven in the afternoon, however it started at quarter past eight! We had to wait all that time without someone to explain  us the reason for this delay. To make matters worse, your theatre restaurant was closed and one of your assistants said that it was being under construction for the expansion of that place. This so-called ""Perfect Evening"" was so disappointing as well as discouraging  of coming to your Circle Theatre again. After all I've been through, I would like a refund of my money. Thank you for your interest. Sincerely yours,   [SEP]  Nowadays, the technology has expanded its ""legs"" to almost every part of our interests, jobs and even hobbies. Therefore, our life has changed a lot since a hundred years ago, as well as mine did. The biggest achievement of modern technology has broken into my house as soon as I was at the age of ten. This achievement is the personal computer, which has grown very fast, because of the help it can provide. My computer helps me in my studies, homeworks and projects for school. With the Internet, I got more socialised using the Relay Chat clients, but also got a kind of boredom, which is known as ""Internet Freak Disease""! I use it a lot so sometimes I feel pain in my eyes or my hands. Moreover, fishing was affected by the modern technology. Fishing is my hobby and that's why I bought these plastic worms and fish, that are not so good - it's better to use alive worms! To sum up, my life is surrounded by modern gadgets. Sometimes these gadgets are for the best and - more often - for the worst!! It only depends of your judgement and the way you're about to use technology. ",23.0
52," Dear Ms Clark, I am writing to thank you for organising the International Arts Festival, in which I participated this year, and to give you my opinion about it. I think that organising this event was a great idea. I was very pleased when I read your advertisement for the festival. One reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events was also an excellent idea. It encouraged me to take part in the festival. Despite all this I would like to complain about some detailes. First of all stars were supposed to come from all around the world. Apparently there were artists from only six countries. All the concerts were great, but some concert halls were too small. There was a terrible lack of room and fresh air inside them. I would also like to suggest  you to try and make more plays and films available next year. I trust you will give this matter your great attention. I look forward to visiting  International Arts Festival next year. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Mary, Thanks for your letter. I'm sorry for not having written earlier, but I've had an exhausting exam session at school. It was very interesting to hear about  rules in England. The rules in Poland are quite similar to those discribed in your letter. We are not allowed to talk during the lesson and we have to do our homework every day. Usually we don't have to wear school uniforms, but there are schools, in which there is such obligation. In most of the schools students have to change their shoes in order not to make the floor dirty. If I could change anything, I would probably lessen the amount of homework. It's hard to find any spare time sometimes! What about home rules? Well, we both know that parents are the ones who rule at home. All the things we're not allowed to do depend on them. Anyway, I must finish now. Has your dog already recovered? I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon. Lots of love, ",35.00
281," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to complain about the musical 'OVER THE RAINBOW'. There were some unfortunate incidents. To begin with, according to your advertisement, discount tickets were availabe. However, I could not get them. So I could  get a good seat. In addition to this, the show was supposed to start at 19.30, but it started at 20.15. As a result, I could not visit the restaurant since it had already closed when the show finished. To make matters worse, it was the different actor although Danny Brook should have starred. I was really looking forward to seeing his role, but on starting the show, I found it disappointed. Can you imagine how upset I was? Finally, I would like to ask you to give some money back to me. I look forward to receiving your satisfactory reply by return of post. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  In my opinion, modern technology has changed my daily life greatly. To begin with, I think the mobile phone is very useful because I can make a phone call wherever I am, without looking for a telephone box. When I meet my friends somewhere but cannot arrive there on time, I can tell them about it with the phone. On the other hand, when I do not want anybody to disturb my time, the phone annoys me. Secondly, as far as I am concerned, the computer is a great invention. With  internet and E-mail, I can get lots of information from everywhere, and I can get in touch with my friends who live in abroad. Since I bought a computer, I have been checking  E-mails from my friend almost every day. Finding them, I feel happy even if there is only one. On balance then, I think that modern technology really affects my life even though I feel that it improves too rapidly  to catch up. ",39.0
97," 59 Gorham Drive St Albans AL1 2HW 17th June 2000 Dear Sir/Madam I am writing to complain about the musical show of ""OVER THE RAINBOW"" which I saw on 15th of June in your theatre. Firstly, I wanted to see DANN BLOCK playing as your advertisement already said, but there was a different actor instead of him at that evening. In addition to this, the show did not start on time, 19:30, so I had to wait for 45 minutes. Another disappointing thing was that you did not explain the reason why it was delayed by 20:15. As for the ticket price, you promised to provide discount tickets, but they were not available. Furthermore, when I went to the restaurant after the show, I found it was closed. Because its opening time was from 10:00 to 17:00. I do not need to tell , either, that I had  awful evening and you are responsible for that. So I am asking  to refund all the money. Thanking  for your prompt attention. I am looking forward to hearing from you soon. Yours Faithfully Tyung Kwa (Miss)  [SEP]  THE REVOLUTION OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY I am checking my e-mail everyday using the Internet, I am talking to my friends who is far away  connecting to network systems, and I am taking my mobile phone. For recent years, as Information Technology has been improved highly, communication methods have been changed to a different way, which is not  same as before. A few years ago, I did not know what  Internet was, how to use it and so on. But, while those have been spread all over the world, I and all the other people who I have known became to use them. I can find out some information at home, although I do not go to  library. I am able to meet my friends quickly in  Internet  just clicking the mouse. In addition to these , I can contact to anyone who I want to talk  at any convenient time in case I need him or her, or I am needed. It is causing some changes to me. So, now I would rather send the e-mail than the letter, and I prefer to surf the Internet when I need to find something. As it has given me different kinds of communication systems, my daily life is more comfortable, relaxed and faster. ",29.0
1104," Dear Sir, I am writing  you to know about some comments and suggestions from some students about the trip you have already organized to London. First of all, we would like to go to the London Fashion and Leisure show which takes place from Monday 13th to Wednesday 15th. It is opened from 10:00 to 19:00 and it is for free for students. This is a great opportunity because we can know more about leisure and fashion from this city. If you allow us to go we could change the programme in this  way. Firstly, on Monday morning we can visit the presentation of the latest fashions and in the afternoon we could take a sightseeing by bus. Secondly, on Tuesday morning we can watch the Leisure  and Sports wear and in the afternoon we can go to the Science Museum and finally, on Wednesday, we can go and see the presentation of different hairstyles and makes up spending the afternoon in the National Art Gallery. We hope you consider our suggestions  letting us know your answer. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  The home of the Future If you think in the future you could think in faster and better machines, advanced technology or  better life. All this will happen in the next 50 years, how can we be prepared to receive all these things in our homes? The next 50 years. Nowadays, our home life allow us to have more free time to spend doing leisure activities like practising sports or going out. In the close future we will be able to do nothing because everything will be done by computers and machines, ( washing-up, hovering, ironing, gardening, cooking, etc. ) The question is, will it be  better life? On the one hand, we will be able to spend more time with our family and not to be worried about anything. No more housework, no more stress, nor more illnesses; everything will be perfect. On the other hand, life will be boring, a large amount of workers will be have redundant and housewives will not have anything to do which will be extremely boring and tedious. What do you prefer? Do you enjoy doing nothing or do you really enjoy what you do? It is your desicion. ",26.00
1037," Dear Mr. Robertson, I have been asked by my classmates to write to you to suggest a new activity which you could include in the London programme if you liked it. We are very grateful to you for these three days that we are going to spend in the English capital, especially because you planned very interesting and different kinds of things to do for all  us. However, all we agree that we would like to introduce a visit to the London Fashion and Leisure Show in the Central Exhibition Hall of London in the trip organisation. I am sure that, if you allow us to go, we are going to enjoy it a lot, to learn new topics about the English culture and have an opportunity to communicate ourselves with all those professional of the fashion. It is a very good chance to join this exhibition to see all the new fashion tendences, the latest hairstyles and make up as all  we came from many different countries and have not the same customs either. And another important thing to consider is that for the students the tickets are free. As the show is held on Tuesday from 10:00 to 19:00 we could go there instead of doing shopping in the afternoon. By this way, we would visit the museum as you had planned and n Wednesday afternoon we could use the free time to do some shopping if we wished it. Well, that is all I wanted to tell you. We do hope you like our suggestion and we can have an agreement to join the fashion exhibition. Yours sincerelly,  [SEP]  Do famous people, such as politicians and film stars, deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time? Some people think that they should. They are human beings actually and they need to keep a little bit of pirvacity and freedom in their lifes to continue like normal people, to feel that they are unknown and anonymus and they do not have to wear sunglasses, hats or caps every time they want to go out home  not to be recognised.. This is supposed to make them happier... Nevertheless, if the famous are known everywhere in the world it is because of the people, if they appear often on TV or in films it is because of their popularity, a popularity which has given to them by all us. So they need to become famous to be what they want and if the people don't know them, they are forgotten, they die... To sum up I would like to say that for me  is very difficult  which group has the reason but, by the moment, we should try to respect each other and go in the other's soul to feel like them in those moments we cannot understand them.

I'am very pleased that I have won the first prize in your competition and I want to tell you that it would be better for me to go to your Camp in July because this month I usually have a rest and now I am thinking about it. So your advice of going to a camp suits me very well. Answering on our first question about where would I prefer to sleep, I prefer tents because it is closer to nature and I like sleepping in sleepping bags (=BV bags). Now let me tell you about my sports preferances. From your list of activities I have chosen swimming and surfing, because all of us went out from  water and we have to go back there. Of course it was a joke, but as I have chosen swimming and surfing I will tell you why. I have chosen them because I am candidat to masters of sports in water polo. And only out of that reason, but also because I like water very much. Also I would like to have a t-shirt with your signature. Yours scinerly Fedor Gapon.  [SEP]  In our lyceum we have  listem of ""double lessons"". It means that every day exept Sunday we have four lessons and each of the lessons lasts for  hour and a half and it means  ""double lesson"". I think that is more convinient than seven lessons every day and each of the lessons lasts fourty five minutes. It is convinient, I mean ""double"" lessons because you have more time to understand  matherial what is givven  and because you have to prepare only four subjects for ""tomorrow"" and it is less then seven subjects. As a student of  economical form I think I should tell you about one day in  time table of our form. For example Tuesday. On Tuesday we have such lessons English, Math, Economics and Phisics. All of these subjects are so important for us that we have never missed them. Especially English and Economics because we are going to become famous economists. Not only these subjects are studied by us, but also Latin, Russian, Ukrainian, Biology and Phisical training, but as we study them we understand that they are not so important as our main subjects.

Because all of them are so important in difference way. As now I'm being away from home,  telephone is very important to me. Having  telephone I can call my mother, my friends which helping me from  home sick, not completely but I think it's better than other ways. To hear the voice from the person you love is the feelling that  hard to describe, it's wonderful and so real, you can imagine their face clearly. I had a problem with my best friend once when we keep in tuch through e-mail.

We are now still friend. Thanks to the invention of the telephone. ",20.00
337," Dear Sir: I'm writting this letter to complain about the musical show I saw during my stay in London. This show was supposed to be a perfect event but actually I had a very disappointing evening. First of all I want to say that I'm very keen on Danny Brook who was one of the main reasons why I decided to come. However my favourite actor was not there. How could that happen? I also would like to know why the musical show started at a quarter past eight instead of half past seven. I spent a lot of time waiting for the show to start. I really do understand that problems can always come up but it would not have been a problem for me as long as I had been informed about it. Of course discounts were not available either, and the restaurant where we were supposed to eat afterwards was closed without any explanation at all. So, what should have been a nice evening out came to a nightmare. I guess all my reasons are more than enough to get my money back. Thank you very much: Yours faithfully:  [SEP]  Modern technology has actually changed my life quite a lot. Firstly I would like to talk about computers. A couple of years ago I bought a new computer and I had to learn all about them. Even though it was my first one I managed and I got to know pretty fast the way they work. Now, I'm just fascinated by  Internet and I spent at least half an hour every day surfing the net, visiting lots of webs and getting all kind of information for free. I'm impressed by communications as well. If I want to communicate with a friend in Australia I just have to send him an e-mail which is going to get to my fellow in a  while. Isn't that amazing? I should not forget mobile phones. If I feel like talking to a friend I just have to call him and whereever he is I will be able to get through to him. Several european companies like Nokia or Ericsson are focusing on mobiles and I have been told that in a couple of years it will be possible to send and e-mail either from the computer or from the mobile which is going to be great. Finally I want to explain that three weeks ago I started working for a new company and my job is all about new technologies. I'm extremly happy because not only do I earn a lot of money but also I'm learning a lot. So, as you can see, modern technology has had  influence in my life. ",37.0

I did it for free because it was a non-profit concert for helping the poor people. It was the first time for me and I consider this experience the best of my life. I had to look after people near the stage. The organiser gave me a radio and I had to advise the other staff members in case of  disorder. At the same time I could enjoy the music! I think this is what I particularly liked about this experience. I suggest you to try this kind of experience. You should be pride of you helping people who suffers, and at the same time you may enjoy yourself! I am looking forward to seeing you! Love ",32.0

We thought that we could change the programme this way: we could go to the Science Museum  Wednesday afternoon instead of Tuesday. I really hope that you  gona consider our request. Yours sincierly,  [SEP]  My dear brother It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. It was a normal Saturday morning. My mam was cooking and my dad was sitting in his chair reading a book. I knew that my brother was at home, althoug I didn't know where . I was doing my homeworks when I heard an explosion. I came out of my room and I saw my brother n fire. He was playing with fire and alcohol in the bathroom. My first reaction was to put him on the floor so that the fire could stop. He was screaming because he had  such a big pain. We were shocked, we all didn't know what to do. I called a taxi because my father wasn't able to drive. We went to the hospital and they cured him. He had to stay there for three long weeks. Since that bad experience he never playied with fire again. I really like my brother and I would do anything possible to save him. ",29.00
12," Dear Mrs Clark, The discovery of the ôInternational Arts Festivalö was a pleasure for me because it gave me the opportunity to enjoy onto a really nice environment. The proposal of reasonably-piced package including tickets and accomodations, well supported my personal organization: comfortable rooms  easy to reach and booked tickets can help you if you decide  at  last minute. As far as the Festival itself is concerned some small improvements could let it works better.  Different kinds of music is a good idea but some of them need special features. Larger concert halls can allow people to better enjoy the quality of  performances. Also the introduction of different cultural experiences is a good idea but six countries can't be really considered as world wide representative. The aim to satisfy different interests should not let the quality decrease. Just a final note: why not  more plays and films for the next year? Thanks in advance for your attention Regards  [SEP]  Are you young, are you a student? Do you want to earn money? You are not alone! There are ôseveralö opportunities for you: - ask for money to your parents (mum is better), is the most traditional way but also the safest one - emprove your kindness and ask for works in restaurants or pubs,  is a good training period for real life too (be patient with demanding people is always required) - test your health and ask for an outdoor activity (seting as  sandwich-man can also hep to test your pride) - check your pal wallet and if you have enough money (a very small amount) you can arrange a trip to reach countries like Phili, Cuba, Zambania,  Morocco where people (poorer than you) will offer small wages for ôsmallö jobs.. you might enjoy your summer holidays and ôfind yourselfö Anyway, the best suggestion is always the ôbest ideaö, the famous ôsuch a good ideaö that might change your lifeà. O'm still looking for it. Good luck! ",30.00
227," 17.6.2000 Dear Sir, I am writing for explaining some problems your theatre has got and asking for some money back. I saw your advertisement and I expected a discounted ticket for students. But in a ticket office I realised I couldn't get it. Another problem was the time. The play was supposed to start at 19.30 but it was delayed so at 20.15 a curtain of the stage was pulled up. As soon as the play had started I noticed another problem. I am a big fan of Danny Book and it was why I chose 'over the rainbow'. When I saw a different actor playing his role I was really disappointed. Las problem I would like to tell you  is  a restaraunt there. After the show I went to the restaurant according to your advertisement but it was closed because of decoration. When I booked the ticket I really expected the show. Unlike my expectation it was so disappointing and annoying. So I would like to ask for some money back. I am looking forward to hearing from you soon. Yours faithfully, TA HYUN PHAT  [SEP]  I remember some sientific cartoons when I was younger I watched on television. They describe the future world where people would travel to the moon. But it is coming true now. Modern technology has been changing even my daily life in positive and negative ways at the same time. First it helps  my social life to be convinient. I have got my own computer so it is easy for me to send e-mails to my friends very often. Second I can save time. If there was no public transport like  underground in a big city I couldn't imagine travelling on time. On the other hand, modern technology could affect my life in a bad way. Because of computeres or telephones I could have less chances to meet my friends than before. It could make my emotions fade. Another problem is pollution. I think a car is one of the most common products of modern technology. The more cars there are on the street, the more difficult it is for me to keep myself fit. To sum it up, as technology is improving my life itself is becoming convinient. In spite of its good sides I think my life could get worse. To live in this world needs somebody else to contact and health. But I am loosing chances to meet my friend face to face and I feel I am getting weaker. I suppose people including me should keep themselves in a limited their own space in near future. It will be caused by technology. ",32.0
242," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writting this letter to complain about the treatment that we have received when we went to the Circle theatre in order to see the musical show ""Over the rainbow"" whose actors were Anthony Keens and Tina Truelove. When we arrived at the Circle theatre in the evening, we were waiting during a long time, because that you advertisement noticed that the musical show would begin at 19:30, and eventually it began at 20:15. Moreover, the actors were not the same of  the advertisement. Finally, after the show we went to the theatre restaurant but it was closed because they were on holidays. This evening was the worst evening of all my life. I would like that you give me back some money of the tickets. I look  to hearing from you soon. Yours faithfully. PEDRO REZ SORAN  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. She told our parents that we were going to get married in Brazil. Because of this, Sally's parents and my parents went to Brazil rapidly. Sally and I had bought a nice big house beside the sea in the outskirts of the city. It had three bedrooms, two bathrooms, one dining room and one kitchen. Indeed, it had a big swimming pool and a beatiful garden. When my parents arrived in Brazil and found us, our dreams were erased. We had to come back to Spain. Because of this, we had to sell the house and left our jobs. When we arrived in Spain, we had to explain  our parents all  our adventure. That day was the worst day of all my  life. Nowadays, Sally and I are married, have three children, a marvellous house and both of us are working in a big company. ",26.0
57," Dear Mrs Clark, I am writing in response to your advertisment in Today's newspaper. I recently spent two days at the International arts festival and I found it very entertaining. It was really a good idea to organize a festival containing such different shows. The idea that I prefered the most was to suggest a reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events because a lot of student or unemployed people could not afford to pay too much money. I went to see a classical concert and, although the music played was excellent, he concert hall was too small. Furthermore, I had expected stars and artists from around the world, but they came from only six countries. A friend of mine went to see the play ""Hamlet"" and the film ""Gladiators"". He told me how great it was and I was thinking that it would be a good to have more plays and films next year. In addition to this, I was wondering if you could organize the same festival in  sommer. I am looking forward to hearing from you in the near future. Yours sincerly,  [SEP]  Two sisters, Alex and Daniela were sitting in front of the fireplace thinking of what they could do. That year, the winter in France was very cold. It was near Christmas and the two girls hadn't found any present for their mother. Offering Christmas presents was a tradition not be forgotten and  only four days left. Alex suggested that it would be a good idea to go to the city to buy that present. Daniela agreed but she knew that it was snowing and that it was dangerous to walk with this kind of weather. Anyway, Alex was too stubborn to give up and it was like talking to a brick wall: she didn't listen to her sister. After forty minutes, the weather became very bad. It was such a pain to walk in the snow. However, Alex was not worried at all despite the fact that her sister was tired and cold. In deep of herself, Alex knew they were lost in the middle of nowhere, but she didn't want to admit it. Unfortuneatly, Daniela fainted. She was so cold that she couldn't move her legs. Alex began to cry and to pray and when Daniela was about to die an angle appeared. He asked Alex if it was more important to bring back a present at home or to save her sister. The answer was obvious and the angel saved Daniela.. This story happend a long time ago. ",35.00

I need material for drinking and eating, that is the basic fact that  I must go shopping for food. It is not enjoyable to see that the prize for food are going more and more higher. My salary are going lower than lower. When I have enough money the price isn't important, then I can buy a lot of goods whitout take care on my money. Despite I have enough money shopping is not always enjoyable too, because I don't know which goods I will buy in the future. Also I will buy goods which I don't need. There are many goods which quality is bad  in this way the environment pollution will be more and more increase. This is the fact that shopping is not enjoyable. ",22.0
174," Dear the manage of  theatre, I went to the circle theatre to see a musical show, OVER THE RAINBOW. I really expected the musical show, but it was a disappointing show. At first, you advertisement said there were Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, but it had different actor disappointely. Secondly, it said the show started at 19:30, but it deleyed to 20:15. I had to wait 45 minutes, wasting time. Thirdly, tickets were £10, £15 and £20, and I knew that these were available to discount, following the advertisement. But it was impossible. And I wanted to visit your theatre restaurant after the show but it was closed though they said it was possible to visit  theatre restaurant after the show, they didn't prepare  at all. Even if one of your woman officer annoyed my question, I asked that why they didn't prepare restaurant, as if they advertised like that. But she was annoyed me. You said it would be  perfect evening, but it wasn't. It was  upset evening. So I ask for money back to you. I couldn't be satisfied  your theatre. I hope you accept my suggestion. With  hopeness  you understand me. Elsy Sun.  [SEP]  Unfortunely, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Pat talks others secrets to everyone easily. At first when he had a girlfriend, they talked to each other franckly. His girl friend talked to him  everything. Because she believed him. But after they seperated, his told his friends her secrets without considering. And when his friend, J, got  big problem, J asked Pat and his friend for help him. It was about his private problem, related  his friendship in  whole school. If he had told everybody, J would have been blamed by  whole school. But he forgot it and told his friends. Actually it was not on his purpose. But sometimes, Pat mistakes to speak someone's secrets. Though it was not on his purpose, it makes his friends leave him. They can't believe him. Pat also regrets about his speaking. It could be difficult for him to change himself. It is like his one of bad habbits. Poor Pat, now he is blamed by everyone such as the people who he talked their secrets to everybody. ",19.0
664," Dear Helen Ryan, I am writing this letter to tell you the informations you need and to ask you one or two questions. I would like to come in july because I work in a big company where you have to take your holiday in this month. For the accomodation at Camp California, I will prefer to have a log cabin because I think it is more comfortable than a tent, and in case it has a big storm with a heavy rain it's more resistant than a tent. For the activities, I chose climbing because I took  cours during 2 weeks last year and now I have a good level , for the other one I chose photography but I am not a proffesional, I just take some pictures in my holiday! I have a little question, could you tell me if and how  money I need to take with me, and which kind of clothes? I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I'm writing this letter to tell you  my good experience at a pop concert, last month. When I came, I was a bit afraid because I did not know what I had to do, but a very nice girl told me that my first job was looking for people whose felt bad and to guide them to the nursery. I did that  two hours , this first job was sometimes a bit boring but I felt like someone who save people, so I was really happy! My second  was to take the money at the bars and to bring them in a little room where I could see the pop star walked in the corridor. I was very excited when I could see a star! The next weekend I have an appointment with one  them, but I don't tell you the name because you'll fell jalous! Maybe I will tell you on the next letter! See you soon Best wishes ",25.0
17," Dear Miss , I am writing to suggest some idea for the International Art Festival next year. I have just been there and noticed some points which could make the festival better. First of all, the festival was a great idea. There were a number of stars and artists from around the world, but from only six countries. Secondly, they held some concerts, but some  concert halls were so small that there was not enough space for  the people. Thirdly, it was nice to see several plays and films. We would be pleased if you could have more. Fourthly, everyone seems to have enjoyed seeing  dance shows and the art exhibitions and listening to the talks. Lastly, the weekend ticket was excellent because it was quite reasonable. However, a ticket for each event is expensive. I suggest you have a oneday ticket or a reasonable ticket for every event. That is everything I have noticed about the festival. I would be grateful if you could think about it. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Sharyl, Thank you for your letter. I really enjoyed reading it. I'm very happy to know you're pretty well. Speaking of rules, most of them are annoying! There're plenty of rules in my high school. For example, girls must keep the length of the skirt by 5 cm under their knees. That's so stupid! It doesn't bother studying, does it? And also we're not allowed to bring any sweets. I know some rules are necessary to control the students. The school uniform is a good example. And the advantage of this is I don't need to think about what to put on every morning! In my house, I'm allowed to do anything unless it bothers somebody. But there's one thing I can't stand up. I'm not allowed to go out late at night. I want to go dancing sometimes. You're allowed to do that, aren't you? That's wonderful! I'm really jealous of you! Take care. I'll write to you soon! Love, ",31.00
5," Dear Jean Clark, I recently spent two days at your Annual International Arts Festival and I am writing to express my opinion about it. Firstly, I think the International Arts Festival is a wonderful idea because I have the opportunity to enjoy different arts events. But it is also true I could just see stars and artists on stage from only six countries, not stars from around the world as you announce in your advertisement. Secondly I really enjoyed the jazz and classical concerts in spite of the fact that some of them were taken place in too small concert halls. Thirdly, all the plays and films showed were interesting, In my opinion you should include some more films and plays in your festival next year. Finally, I think it was a good idea the fact to buy only one ticket for all the events since I just spent the time watching and enjoying all of them. I look forward  hearing from you. Your sincerely  [SEP]  Dear George, Sorry it's been too long since I last wrote but I've been so busy at school that I couldn't answer you before. As you tell me in your last letter you were talking about rules in your class and you want to know about school rules in my country and also what I am allowed to do at home. First I must tell you that  teachers are strict at school. We aren't allowed to eat in the classrooms and in addition to this we must sit down in individual desks. We can't chat with our classmates. How boring! At home everything is quite good,  mum and dad are great but there's one main rule I must tell them were I go and what time I'll come back. Granny is the problem  she's a bit bossy! She usually tells me what to do and what kind of clothes I should wear but I don't care about it. I really must get down to some homework now so I'll stop here. Give my love to your parents.

171," London, June 17th, 2000 Dear Sir, Last week I bought some tickets to the musical show ""Over the Rainbow"", thinking that I would have a perfect evening, like its advertisement tell us. Unfortunately, I had a terrible evening. At first I became worried because there wasn't any discounts available, like your advertisement say . And I became even more angry  to have to wait 45 minutes for the show to begin. It's necessary to start on time, and your paper was informing  that it would begin at 19:30. It didn't happen. To complete my sadness, the main actor was replaced by another one who I've never heard anything from, and did not have the same talent that the one shown on the advertisement do. I'm writing to you to complain about this show, and to ask for my money back. It isn't fair not returning the money for a person who bought tickets to watch a show that was supposed to be great, but actually was a shame. I'm looking forward to your answer. Cordially,  [SEP]  Secrets between friends Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. And because of that, everyone at school happened to know that Ali was dating Nick, that used to be Caroline's boyfriend at the time. Pat was Ali's best friend, and because of that, Ali told her that she was going out with Caroline's boyfriend, but asked her to keep the secret. One week later, everyone at school started to laugh at Caroline and look down on Ali and Nick. Caroline discovered everything, and argued with the infidel couple. It was a big quarrel, people that were many meters distant could hear it. Pat entered the fight, and it became more loud and agressive. One more week has passed, and things became calm: Ali decided to never look Pat on the fact anymore. They have turned themselves into big enemies. And Nick told her that his real love was his girlfriend Caroline, and that they weren't going to break up. Poor Ali.. So, it's very important to be a person than can keep secrets, even your own secrets, or a friend's one. One of the most beautiful things on the world is the true and loyal friendship. Then, we have to be as best secret keepers as possible, or we will end  like Ali and Pat. ",25.0
968," Dear Sir/Madam, I received your letter this morning and I was very suprised  it. It was  absolutely fantastic prize. I am writting  you about your questions. First, I can come there only  July because of my examination, I have to take it in June, and my new turm will also start in September. I would like to stay at long cabins because I have stayed at tents many times in my childhood. The most exciting offer is your activities. I have been interested in Painting but I have not had a chance so I would like to do it, and I would like to do climbing. My grand father used to do it when he was a student. After he has got a job, he became busy. However, he retired  his job last year so he has had his own time. If I know how to climb, I will enjoy it with my grand father. I would like to ask about my clothes and money. How much do I need to bring them? I wish I could see you soon. Your faithfully,  [SEP]  Dear Kim, How are you? You want to know about my experience at a pop concert, don't you? It was so exciting! My main working was take people to their seat because of a concert hall, which was the millenium dorm. Do you know it? It's the hottest place in England. Most of  people were first time to come there, so they're lost. I had also never been there before. It's a huge building. I also sold a panfulet of that concert, CD and T-shirts. The most exciting experience was that I could met a lot of people. I told you before that concert was performed by Elton John, so there were a lot of famouse people. When I saw Jullia Roberts, I was socked. She was abusolutelly beautiful. I have never seen that kind of long legs in my life! Did you enjoy my letter? I can't explain  you very well. Anyway, it was a wonderful time. lots of love, ",26.0
147," Sir manager, I am writing in order to complain about what you have written in the advertisement on the newspaper. I am disappointed because of the horrible evening I have had, I was on holiday in London and I did not have time enough to spend there, but when you said that  show was the best I decided to go. When I bought my ticket I asked for a discount and they said it was not available. At first it was not a problem because if the show was going to be the best it would cost what they said. I arrived at the theatre in time and the musical show started later than I expected so I was getting nervous because I dislike very much the impuntuality, but that was not all. When the show started the person who was acting  it was not Danny Brook and he seemed not to be an actor. Really he was bad. Afterwards I decided to go for a meal in the theatre restaurant but It was closed. So you can imagine how I felt because of the irritating evening out I had. I am letting down because of your behaviour. You wanted to cheat me, so I will be very pleasure if you could give my money back. I am looking forward  your answer. Your faithfully,  [SEP]  I think technology has changed my life and the way of living of almost all people around the world. First of all technology is very useful nowadays but really I dislike it because in some ways we are becoming machines too. Since the creation of PCs, people - and me too, of course - are making different things. For example we can buy food, clothes and whatever we need by internet or by telephone. I can know what is happening in differents parts of the world in a few minutes. A very good point of this change is that women have more freedom to have a job because before  reaching the technology they have to stay at home doing housework but now we have laundries and a lot of machines like microwave oven. In my case I dislike computers. I don't know how to use them but I know I have to change because they help us to make our lives easier. On the other hand what will happen with us in the future? Our life will be managed by robots and they will replace us in our jobs. So, what are we going to do? Something that I note about technology is that we are loosing green places and there are a lot of pollution, so we have to be careful. ",29.0
1170," Dear Mrs Smith. I am writing in response to your letter in order to give you some further information about the international student conference in our college. I would like to inform you that your group has been booked into  Palace Hotel. It is situated in the center of our town and it takes five minutes to get to the college, where the conference is going to be held. I think that the best choise for you is to take the 234 bus. The bus stop  you should get off is called ""The Green Man"". With reference to the end-of-conference party, which is going to take place on Tuesday from 8:00 until midnight, I would like to mention the necessary dress code. It is an evening dress for women and black trousers, a white shirt and a black bow tie for men. Lastly, I would like to give you some suggestions about way in which you can spend your free time in our town. I am strongly convinced, that you should visit  local Science Museum. Also there is a very good shopping center next to the museum. I look forward to seeing your at the conference and hope that you will have a good time in our town. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  As it is widely known, lots of different and important things were invented during the 20th century, nevertheless I believe that the most important one is the computer. It is a fact, that the modern society have created the demand for the ability to cope with the vast amounts of information. Taking it into consideration I would like to say that the computer is the priceless invention for an accountants, designers, engineers and so on and on. Another point in  favour is the possibility to connect to the Internet. It allows you to have all the necessary information ""on your fingertips"". Also not least importantly is the role of computers in the process of production in factories around the world. On the other hand there are some disadvantages. For instance a lot of children nowadays replace their real life with the virtual world, which computers create. Another drawback is that in industry computers replace people's labour, which leads to the increasing of unemployment. To conclude I would like to say that the goverments of all developed countries wouldn't have been so concerned about  so-called ""problem 2000"" if the computer had not been so important for the modern society.

83," Ireland, 16 December 2000 Dear Mrs Clark, I am writing to you about the International Arts Festival which took place these 21 and 22 November. I think it is a great idea to have this kind of festival in our region and I really enjoyed most of the events I went to. However, I feel that it could be even better next year. Firstly, according to your advertisement, the 'Stars and artists from around the world' came from only six countries. I felt quite disappointed as everybody knows that ""our"" world is full of different cultures. Maybe not enough were represented. In spite of the fact that the classical concerts were really good, I think that some concert halls were too small and so not everybody could appreciate the good quality of the music. I really enjoyed the plays and films, I wonder if there would be more next year? I hope so! Finally, I would like to tell you that the idea of one reasonably-priced ticket for the weekend is excellent, we can go where we want to, see what we feel like to. However, I think a weekend is really too short. May I suggest you to think about doing the festival over one week. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Magda, Thanks very much for your letter. As you asked me in it, here are some  school and home rules in my country, France. First of all, and I think it's a big difference with England, children don't wear uniforms at school. I was very surprised when I saw them in your country. It was a bit funny for me. Of course when you're in class you have to behave yourself, be polite with the teacher and the other school children. During the break too, usually some teachers stay out and keep an eye on you. I think nowadays, children are more free and heard, I mean  the contact between them and adults. Usually they know what they're allowed to do or not and if they don't respect it, the teacher not only punishes them ( not always) but also speaks with them. At home  is different, each family has its own rules. As I am concerned, when I was a child, I was not allowed to stay  very late with my parents and sometimes I wanted to because I was not tired. But I was a wise child, so! Usually, at home, like at school, you have to behave yourself but differently, because you're at home so you feel more confident. There are some rules like ""don't speak with a full mouth""; ""don't put your finger in your noise""; ""say please and thank you""; ""don't fight with your brother""; and so on, but I think it's the same everywhere. Well, I hope I've helped you a little and I look forward to hearing from you soon. With lots of love, ",34.00
98," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing  you to complain about ,,Over the Rainbow"" musical show which took a place in The Circle Theatre several weeks ago. First of all,  advertisement for the shows provided absolutely WRONG information about  actors. Danny BROOK, who should play according  your advertisement was replaced by an another actor and it disappointed me. The show should start at 19.30, however, the audience have been waiting for fourty five minutes. Also, in the advertisement you have mentioned discounts which were not provided. The theatre restaurant was closed that evening and I had not recieved the explanations why. On the whole, the evening was boring and disappointing. Based on everything listed above, I would like to recieve  £10, which I have paid, back. The ticket for the show is included. Look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  How has morden technology changed my life. New technologies have become the part of our lives. There are a lot of arguments about the weather this influence is negative or positive. Nevertheless, it has affected every person and hopefully in a good way. Personally, I consider modern technologies as a positive innovation. Using  microwave oven or vacuum cleaner saves me a lot of time. Computer is extrrmely convenient in writing reports and essays. And, of course, I can not forget about cars and planes that deliver us to all parts of the Earth. However, many people, insist that new technologies affect people in a negative way. I would better prefer seeing my father talking to his family instead of staring at blue screen of TV. But also, I would not be able to imagine my life without the nice way of reciving news with help of it. Counting  pros and cons, I tend to think that there are more positive points in working out and manufacturing new technologies than negative ones anyway. Modern girl or boy already would not be able to imagine life without them. ",27.0

On the hall of our classroom we have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and we would like to go to the show  is it possible. We know that we will spend three days in London in a  with a determinate programme. First of all we make thanks for the good programme  especially for  the Science Museum on Tuesday 14th About the London Fashion and Leisure Show we are very excite to go because it's on extravagant and unusual show with leisure, sports wear and hairstyles. As I see  your programme the shopping  is at the same time of the London Fashion  so I'll make you a suggestion: we'll start in the morning with the Science Museum and immediately after we'll go to  Central Exhibition Hall without doing  shopping. It would be a great opportunity because for students it's free. If you don't have problems we attend yours, we hope good answer. Thank you  [SEP]  I think that my house isn't  of the future. It is comfortable, not too big with a lot of carpets and antiques components for example potterys, my bed, and a wardrobe of my grandmother. Think people's homes will be different in the future about the new materials of structures, they will have a lot of computers for doing recipes and making  shopping while you are staying at home. We will have a relaxing room, with soft light, music New Age and a lot of essences. I think that we can't stop the progress but if we want we can conserve  traditional things. The home of the future will be very impersonally and the atmosfear will be cold and very essencial. ",24.00

We found the advertisment in a local newspaper article and have been thinking it could be such a good opportunity, because the show consists on these topics: . Latest Fashions . Leisure and sports wear . Make up . Hairstyles. On the other hand, and the most important, it is free for students. After being discussing , we want to suggest how we think the programme should be re-arranged. Instead of going to the science museum, we could go to the London Fashion and Leisure Show wich is opened on Tuesday, march 14 from 10 am to 19 pm. After that we could continue our trip as it had been arranged previously. Yours sincirely  [SEP]   Best Detective Stories of Agatha Christie - Agatha Christie. A good book should interest, amuse or teach the reader something. Agatha Christie always was my favourite writer. Not only because she's famous or wrote lots of books, but she knows how to introduce caracthers or how to tell a good story us though decieving the readers. One of her most interesting and famous work is a novel called ""The Orient Express"". It's a detective story, like all the stories written by her. In our words the story is settled on a train wich tooks a trip along the orient. On the train, all the passangers seem to be involved in a crime. This is such a fasinating story or it's the way Agatha Christie tells it. The mistery is kept until the last page of the book. I read it and I have really enjoyed it. It has been  fabulous experience so if anybody would like to read a good detective story, try to read Agatha Christie's detective story and you wouldn't regret it at all. ",11.00
1217," 12th June 2001 Dear Mrs Smith, I am writing to inform you some information about an international student conference. First of all, the hotel which the group has been booked into is The Princes Hotel. It is very near York Railway Station  which you can get there easily. By rail: get off at York station and you can walk from the station turn left and the hotel is on your left hand side. By bus: most of the buses in York City Centre pass the station, or you can take a taxi. Secondly, the conference is  very important event for all of us, we agree to wear formal dresses. For example, men should wear suits, ties and the so on. In addition, at the end-of-conference party, we also have a country dancing show. It could be very special because all the dancers are from our group. Finally, on the last day we have an afternoon free. It would be grateful If we could go for a walk around the city of York and visit the historic buildings. If you could think of any other ideas It would be very kind of you. I would be grateful if my idea and all the information could help you. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Inventions have affected all our lives! Nowadays, a lot of things are invented and make our lives are more convenient than those days. A car is one of the invention which is very useful. I think a car is very important to me because it's very convenient for everyday life. For example, I can travel to many places in the U.K. Especially,  I live in Whitwell-on-the-Hill (a village near Malton in North Yorkshire). Can you imagine if I hadn't got a car how could I go shopping, go to college and so on? In fact, there are buses (number 843 and 845) which go pass my village but the bus fares is very expensive for me. Apart from that it takes  long time to go somewhere. The car has largely affected my own life. I can go anywhere by car a lot quicker than  use public transports. I can listen to the radio and sometimes can listen to Thai music which I brought some cassets with me from Thailand. I took a car driving theory test last October and I passed it and I will take a pratice driving test very soon. I think I have to drive the car myself, so that it will know more about the advantages of using the car. In conclusion, I think  car is very important to me and it has affected my own life. If I have more money I will buy another car. I think it has more advantages than disadvantages. So, we should say many thanks to the person who invented a car! ",27.00
662," Dear Helen Ryan, Thank you very much for your letter. I'm very surprise, to won this prize. About the information, I  like to travel on July because it's only the month  I have  vacation. It's very difficult to change it. About the accommodation at Camp California I will prefer tents because I like the nature and I like to listen  the birds. At the camp I will like to practise tennis and golf. My level in this two activities is medium, I never practise them all. I would like to ask you some question. How many money take us? or is necessary? What can of clothes met it? In the first prize you including a second person like my husband? It's necessary for the activities to wear special clothes? Thank you another time for this first prize  two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. I'm very happy. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable. Last weekend I went to Barcelona with some friends to shop. When we arrived to the shopping center, I saw a lot of people. I don't understand why they was a lot of people. My friends and I, I went to a fashion shop  ""Mango""  to buy some clothes. Nobody at the shop came with us to help. There are four gays, in this shop. We asked them if someone of them  help us. Finally, a girl very friendly came with us. We bought some trousers, tee-shirts, and one pair of shoes. My friends bought some things like a red trousers and white tee-shirts. After this, we returned to Andorra. But not always it's the same history because I like shopping and I think I'm enjoy. Not all the time the people are not friendly in the shops.  ",20.0
1190," Dear Mrs Smith I have received your letter, which was about that you would like me to inform you. As you know, a hotel whose name is  Palace Hotel has been booked for your group. The best way to get from there to the conference is to take a taxi. I am afraid there are no buses to get there. We will have a great party at the end of the conference. The party will be formal, therefore you have to wear formal clothes like a suit or a dress. As you know, it is not suitable to wear a jean or something . On your last day you have an afternoon free. In my area there is a fantastic park, which is the most famous park in the country. You can find a lot of things to do or to see. You can visit the zoo or walk around the amazing lake in the park. I hope you will find all the details, which you would like to have in the letter. If you need any  information, please let me know. Your Sincerely,  [SEP]   Power Of Computurs. How much can a computer affect your life? I think it effects  more than you think. When I was a child I always wanted to get the lyrics of the songs that I liked, but it was nearly impossible to have them. I felt  lack of them. I first bought a computer as I was in university. It was so necessary for me because I wanted to be a computer programmer.  That time I met the magic world of computers. Linking to the internet was so popular.  Internet was something amazing for me. Can you think you have every   information you need whenever you want ? Can you think you  contact with anyone who is from any country whenever you want ? I meet a lot of people on  internet and it really interest me. I learn a lot about their culture by speaking  them on  internet. I wasn't able to imagine this before. In addition  this, today companies can do nothing without a computer. Everything in this world works with computers from now on. Computers changed my life style, my opinion about the world. And they effect everyone's life directly or indirectly. ",26.00
95," Dear Sir or Madam, Last Saturday I went to your theatre to see the new musical show; ""Over The Rainbow"" It was writing on the advertisement that Danny BROOK was going to play with Tina TRUELOVE, but it was not him who played. That disappointed both me and the people who just went to see him. And  the Times; the show had to start at 19:30, however it started at 20:15. Therefore, people there had to wait for 45 minutes. Also, there was said  to be discounts for the ticket but I saw nothing like this. All  people there gave the same amount of money. After the show, I went to the restaurant in the theatre to eat something but it was closed because it was being cleaned that day. I had a horrible evening, just the opposite of what I expected, so I want my money back. Your faithfully,  [SEP]  THE BIG FAULT Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. It was a big fault to gave her a secret, especially an important one. It all started two years ago. Rod was a happy man at that times. One day, while he was gardening, he saw an old lady being kidnapped by some strange man, who he ran after and  caught one of whom. Just then, the strange man took out his gun. Rod jumped on him and the man killed himself ,by his own gun. Nobody saw or nobody heard what had happened. Rod told this to nobody, except Pat, his best friend. One day, when they were arguing, Pat was very anxious and told what she knew to  police. Rod was arrested that day and was sent to prison. He then was killed by the other man who escaped that day and was caught soon afterwards. Rod's grave is now in prison. And these lines writes on his gravestone: Here lies the poor body of Rod, Never give your secrets away, This is why poor Rod died. And everyone was surprised. ",29.0
26," Dear madame Jane Clark, I am writing this letter in order to make some suggestions for the International Arts Festival that took place a while ago. I was there  two days enjoying it and have found some points I would like to change to make it a better one next year. I personally think it is a great idea to gather all different types of arts from all over the world. Well, here are some of my opinion and suggestions. First of all, I think there should  more stars and artists from more countries because this year, I believe there were artists only from six countries which, in my opinion, is not quite from all over the world. The jazz, rock and classical concerts were really entertaining except that there were some concert halls  to small for the audience: I'm sure that you can find bigger halls for next year. By the way, I was also wondering if it was possible to have more plays and films for the coming up festival as the reaction of the people was excellent. Actually, the price of the weekend ticket was excellent! I, myself, was expecting a more expensive ticket as there were so many magnificient events. Well, I hope you found my suggestions reasonable as I deeply congratulate  for the great sucess in the festival. yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Emily, Hello! It's been such a long time since we wrote to each other. Well, in the letter you wrote me, you asked some questions about school and house rules. Even though, I do have less than you, I'm still willing to change many things. In our school, you're not allowed to eat during class. You must have a permission to get out of your seat or leave the classroom. My school's an American school so you're not supposed to talk in Spanish during the classes either. At home, there are less rules. My parents don't really like putting rules in the house. But still I cannot go out of the house without telling my mom where I am going and when I'm coming back. But it existed since I was very young. I would like to change the rule  not to speak in Spanish at school because most of us feel more comfortable speaking in Spanish but I guess to learn. we should speak English all the time. Well, that's all. I hope one day you get to change what you wanted. I miss you and let's keep in touch. Bye.. your Pal, ",32.00
1110," Dear Mr Robertson, I am a student of the English class. All my class mates are looking forward to go to London. Thank you so much for organising such a great program. I am writing  you about changing our plan on Tuesday 14 March. The students in my class have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and we would all like to go to the show. The advertisement saids it is taking place on Tuesday 14 March from 10am to 7pm. Since the London Fashion and Leisure Show is not taken place so often and also they will offer the students for free entrance fee this time, if we joined in this show, it would be  great opportunity for us. For these reasons, we would like to suggest you to go to the show instead of going shopping on Tuesday afternoon. I hope I will hear from you soon. I am sure that our travel is going to be great. Thank you very much Sincerely,  [SEP]  It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it.  Otherwise I had to keep walking untill the train start. Have you stayed at a park during the night? When I did that, I was traveling around Japan. It was the very last day of my trip and at that time I was in Kyoto. Although I intended to stay at  youth hostel, I could not find any place to stay, and also it was too late to buy a train ticket to go back home. It was a windy spring day. I was sitting under a full-bloomed cherry blossam tree. Inside the dark, I was alone and only the moon light helped me to see the things. I was regretting I risked staying at the park alone. Suddenly,  strong wind blew up the thousands and thousands  pieces of flowers. It was like a dream. I saw the pink colored snow there. Sometimes when we risk a great danger, it turns into a great experience.  ",30.00
190," Dear Sir or Madam, I have recently been to the Circle Theatre and watched the musical show - over the rainbow. I am writing to you because there were deviations from the advertisement which is published on the newspaper. According to the advert, it says clearly that discounts are available, but when I was buying the tickets, I did not have this offer. As a result, I had to pay the full price of £15. The second point is that the show had a delay of about 30 minutes. Although I believe there must have been problems, I expect your company managed to sort it out in the quickest way. Apart from that, the most disappointing fact is that there were different actors instead of Danny brook and Tina Truelove, for whom I was coming. After the show we went to the Theatre restaurant, but it was closed due to the refurbishment. I am not really satisfied about the show and I certainly believe that it was not a perfect evening out. I therefore would like to have a compensation of  £30 which I spent on the tickets. Your Sincerely   [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. My story had already been spread out the next day. Although failing in the exams wasn't really a big deal, it was awful that people kept mentioning it. I thought I was not going to survive after failing the exams and my best friend had been untrustful. but this idea was soon be put off since I noticed on the newspaper that I had won the writing competition. I couldn't believe my luck, I was really sure that I won a return ticket to the Meditarenian Sea. During the trip, I made friends with other people who had also won the competition in their towns. They were so kind to me that we soon became good friends. The last few days, we spent our time on sightseeing and shopping. I must admit that it was the greatest time I have ever had in my life. On the last day when I was packing and getting ready to leave, I realised I had lost my passport and tickets. A horrible thought suddenly came into my mind. My bad luck had never left me. It had only hidden away from me and when there was a chance, it was going to give me a 'surprise'. ",29.0
1121," Dear Mr Robertson, I am writing about our class trip to London. First of all, I appreciate you well-organised programme, especially,  ""River Trip to Greenwich"" which we requested. It would be the most excising activity in this trip. However, I saw the advertisement of ""THE LONDON FASHION AND LEISURE SHOW"" in the newspaper today, and told all  classmates about it. We are very interested in going  this show. So I would like to suggest you to change the part of  programme for visiting this show. This show is held in  Central Exhibition Hall, London on Tue. 14, March, and  open from 10:00 to 19:00. We can see the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up, and hairstyles which we will learn  next term. Therefore, I think it is  great idea to visit the show for our knowledgement. Furthermore, the addmission is free for students. Unfortunately, our programm is fixed but I think we could change the part of the programme. For example, ""shopping on 14, March' can be changed to 15, March instead of ""Free time"". So we will be able to use the time at the afternoon on 14, March for visiting the show. I hope that you would give us an opportunity to visit the show. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours Sincerely,  [SEP]  Some people said that famous people such as politicians, and film stars, needs to have a private life without journalists following them all the time. I strongly agree with this. Firstly, most people might remember the sad story of ""Princess Diana"" she died in Paris  few years ago while she was escaping from lots of journalists called ""Paparach"". If she was not followed by journalists, she wouldn't die. So, this fact shows obviously that famous people without  private life could be the victim. But on the other hand, ordinary people, including me, are keen on watching film stars or super models fashion. Moreover, people are interested in their life style. I think that is the reason why journalists are still chasing famous people after ""Princess Diana's"" accident. However, secondly, famous people are not ""ailen"" so that they might do something, for example, ashame things in  public space or argument with  partner or family even put on  swimming costume like us. So they can be just ordinaly people like us. We have to think about  this way. Overall, people should think  if we were famous people... and then we can find the answer that all people, including famous people, need  private life and would like to behave in ordinaly life.

1165," Dear Mrs Smith As you know I am in charge for organise the conference in my college. Do not worry if Richard did not left you all the information. I am pleased to help you. We looked in every hotel in Town trying to give you the best offerd. We found two good hotels but we decided for the Palace Hotel. This has the best price that we could find. The conference day our school driver is going to pick you up in the hotel and take you to the conference. The party is going to be in a local discotheque near the college so the best way to get there is walking. You do not have to wear any special kind of clothes but in my opinion you can wear very cassual . Finally,  the last day I sugget you to go to the mall where you can enjoy shopping and looking around. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Introduction The aim of this report is to recomend you to visit the Fuerte de San Diego Musseum. This is an historical building. I asked to some pleople in town and this was the best place to choose. History The Fuerte de Sandiego Musseum was build at the time when the Spanish people was trying to take all the lands from Mexico, one of the most important people who was at front of the Fuerte was Hernon Cortez, the first Spanish in have more lands than anyone at that time. Place The Musseum is situated in front of the sea in the centre of Acapulco. Is situated in the top of a little mountain in the ""old"" part on the city. You are able to get there by car or walking and see everything which was made at that time. Conclusion On the whole this is the best building in Acapulco for his history and reputation. Is the best place to go and   easy to get there. ",29.00

676," Dear Helen Ryan I am shocked that I won first prize in this competition. It will be a great adventure to visit Camp California. I am writing to inform you that I would like to travel in July. The reason is that I am a full-time student on Cracow University and I have many exams at the end of  semester, which is in June. I hope that it is not a problem. I would like you to know that I prefer a tent. I think it is much better than a log cabin. Aspecially in the summer when  tempereture and humidity are very high. From the list of all  activities I have choosen photography and golf. Since secondary school I am very interested in taking pictures and I have a big experience in it. I have choosen golf because I have never played in this game. Please, send me any information of what should I take with me. Should I bring my camera, warm clothes or any pocket money? I am waiting for your reply. Yours sincerely Rafael Szymanski  [SEP]  Dear Kim Thank you for your latest letter. It was really very nice. I know that you're waiting for any information about a concert. Here it comes... My friend offered me a job as a member of  techical staff on Sting's concert. I love his music and I collect his albums so I was very happy that I helped his crew. Our job was to prepare the scene. We've built it using ready metal and wodden parts. It was really big and impressive. Then we had to plug  all electric instruments, speakers, lights and microphones. I was working with a specialist who had to connect all  lights together to one computer and prepare a colorful show. It was a totally new experience for me and a real pleasure of working with professionalists. It was a hard and complicated job but we all had a lot of satisfaction during the concert. Even Mr. Sting came to us to thank  for our help. I hope that you liked my story. Send me your opinion about that. I wish to see your letter soon Rafael ",31.0
921," 13.06.2000 Dear Mrs Ryan, Your letter which says I won first prize in your competition has just been arrived. I love to come  the camp  California. Thank you very much for making my dreams real. I always want to go and se  USA! I would like to answer your questions about this trip. Before everything, I'm living in Leeds and also studying English in a college. Such being the case, I need to wait until my college's lessons finishes. If it's possible for you I would prefer to come in July. Before this time, I usually stay in log cabins, But I never had  chance for staying in a tent. According to me, to say in the tents is mor exciting than to stay in the log cabins. That's why, I would love to choose tents for living for 2 weeks! On the other hand, I've just learnt from your letter that I can have some sport activities during the camp. I'm very happy about this. Because, I spent most of my scholl life  for sports, specially for basketball. But, after staring to work, I hadn't any chance for playing basketball. Now, you gave  a opportunity. As a my second activities, I would like to choose photography, because my education was including photography, I love to take some photographs about nature. Meanwhile, I'd like to ask some questions to you. When I'm coming, what king of clothes could  be able to wear in there? And also, what do you think how much money, I'll need to spend for two weeks. I'm looking forward for your answers. Thank you very much. Your sincerely. Elif  [SEP]  Dear Kim, Hello! I hope you're fine. Because, in these days I'm very happy.

They mixed up the our traditonal  and pop music. I also helped them before the concert started. I learnt how to be ready for a big concert! Lots of people came  this area, and I also learnt how to arrange something. Then I was very tired but I enjoyed with the music very much. I hope next time, if you come hear, we can go together,  may be you can help me! I would like to learn,  what's happening in your life, as well. Take care... Loves ",21.0
1017," Dear Mr Robertson, The reason of my letter, is that our class would like to suggest a few changes on our programme of London, because we have seen an advertisement about an interesting activity that we could include in our programme. First of all, we want to say thanks to you because we know the effort you have done organising our good programme, but we would really like to go to the London fashion and leisure show we saw in the advertisement. We think that perhaps in Tuesday March 14, we could change the time of going to  Science Museum, and (we) go earlier to the Museum, such as half past eight on the morning, so we could go after, at ten o'clock to the show, and we could also delay going shopping on that afternoon, because the show lasts til seven o'clock on the evening. And we have thought that we could go shopping the next day, because we do not have nothing to do on that afternoon. Finally, we would like to say you to think about our suggestion, the show would be fantastic, we would know about the latest fashions, the Leisure and sports wear, and also learn about how to make up. It's a great opportunity to know more about fashion. Please, let us go to the show, for students are  free. I Look forward to hearing from you Yours sincerely  [SEP]  I think that the home of the Future would probably be better than it is now. In the future, our homes will have the most advanced technologies. Computer will take a important part in our daily life, so that we won't go shopping, because in the computer we would buy whatever we want. Books will gradually disappear, and instead we will read all the things we want in our computer. We won't have the necessity of going out from home, because  computer will give us everything. Although computers will give us all the material things, it could not give us things like the feeling of being in your home, have, etc. That things won't change in our home. We will live in our homes with our family, who will give us love ..., that kind of things will never change. In conclusion, in the future home our conditions of life will approve, and  computer will be very important for us, but is won't control us, because we still have the most important thing of a home = have, that will be the same as now.

I'm sorry but I am very dissapointed with the musical show. I would like to explain  you my experience because I want you to give  my money back. The last Monday, I went to the theatre with two friends. We arrived on time but the musical show was delayed untill half-pass eight. Moreover, we hadn't any disscount for beeing students. On the other hand, the main actor was changed for another and nobody told us. When there was a restful we went to the restaurant which was closed because it was late. We couldn't have a drink. Well I believe that it was a bad day but I would like you to give  my money back because on the advertisement there was some things that we hadn't  in the theatre. Finally, it would be grateful if you could answer me soon. Yous sincerelly,  [SEP]  Our lives are changing. When I was a child I had different entertainments  that the actually children hadn't. We could play with our toys, dolls and we could enjoy  without a computer. We hadn't so many machines than they have. The technology is growing and growing. If you have a computer you will be able to have all the information that you want. It's very important but some times it is a wrong thing because the children can see it too. Moreover you can change the TV programme without getting up. We can find information about the weather, sports on our TV-text. On the other hand, the science is changing. We have more researchers than some years ago and we will be able to find the solution of lots of problems. Actually, we can cure illness which were very dangerous before. I'm sure that in a couple of years we will see cured some illness like cancer, UTH. The new technology is changing our lives. ",23.0
30," Ideas to improve the Festival Dear Jane Clark, I went to the International Arts Festival and saw some interesting things, but many points could be better. That is why I write to you, to give you some suggestions that you can take into consideration or not. Firstly, it is a good idea that the Festival is International. But in the advertisement it was written that the artists were from all  the world and I saw only six nationalities. Secondly, the classical concerts were excellent and the halls were so crowded that nobody could walk. In my opinion, it would be important to rent bigger halls next year. Thirdly, I noticed that the plays and the films were a good entertainment. It attracted a lot of people and they were really joyous after that. Finally, the reasonably price of the tickets for the weekend was a good point, because all kind of people an afford to buy it. I also think that you should put a Snack-Bar or a little restaurant so as the people are not too hangry and morever you can realise big benefits In conclusion, in the whole the Festival was a success, but these suggestions can maybe help you to improve . I hope you will not take this letter as a complaint and I look forward to going to the next festival. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Home and school rules Dear Andrew, I receive your letter and thank you for it. I am very happy to hearing from you and I hope that you are fit. As expected, I want to talk at first about my school and then about my home. As you know, I finished school two years ago. This year, I started a private school in Dijon. So the rules are clear, you need to participate to the lessons and also be successful at the exam of June 2000. In our class, we don't have  problem with students who dislike to work, because we are all there for the same reasons and nobody wants to say there  years and years. It is also expensive and I can't afford to stay there too long. In my sweet home, my parents let me do what I want, because I am an adult now. But when we are in society, we have to be careful not to disturb the other persons. It is the same in our family and for example my parents dislike hearing music in the whole house or that I let dust everywhere. When I go out, they don't give me an hour to be at home, because I don't exagerate. In conclusion, I don't want to change something in my house or at school, because I totaly agree with the few rules that I have. I hope these few  information can help you and I look forward to hearing from you Best wishes ",26.00

We have seen it in the advertisment and I would like to go to the show.

I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible. Yours Faithfully,  [SEP]  All the people have the right to have a private life without others people to disturb them  following  all the time. The journalists follow the famous people, such as politicians and film stars, in order to take fotos and  other information about them. After that  journalist sell their information in the newspaper and magazines in order to earn money. I thin that it is very dangerous because the famous peple cannot have you private life and on the other hand they may suffer from deppresion and sadness which may be lead them to suicide. I think that the goverment have to protect them and their private life from the journalist,  punishing them. I think that the government I responsible for the private life of the people. All the people have the right to live free without to be disturbed by other . ",23.00

To begin with, I must explain to you that the party is a surprise for Mr. Brown and it would take place on Tuesday 16th of June from 3:00 to 6:00 pm at the college canteen.

We hope to see you at the party and have a wonderfull time together. I will look forward to hearing from you soon.  [SEP]  My favourite season of the year is summer. I think that most of the people love summer, especially the people in Greece. I dont know why but the summer it is the most beautiful season. All the scenery with the lovely sun, the wonderful beaches, the green mountains and the smell of the sea, make me feel great. I live in Greece, and especially in an island, so I know very well what summer means. It means swimming at the wonderfull beaches, tasting the delicious foods ad having  wonderful time every day and every night with your friends. Also it means to meet other people, to have fun together, to travel at all the places of the island. I think that the summer makes people to feel great, to have fun, to enjoy themselves. I believe that the summer is a season for everybody who wants to have  wonderful time and wonderful memories wherever the go. ",28.0
688," Dear Mrs. Ryan, I am writing as a reply to your letter, congratulating me to the winning of the first prize in your competition and inviting me to the Camp California in the U.S.A. I was delighted to hear from you and am already looking forward to spend two weeks in California. I am afraid that the only possible time for me to travel is in July because it is the only month I am able to get time off work. As an accomodation I would prefer sleeping in a tent because I enjoy the closeness to the nature while camping a lot. The two activities that I would like to do at the Camp are sailing, which I have never done before and tennis which I already play quite well. I need to know how much money you would advise me to bring and what sort of clothes I should take with me. I am looking forward to your reply at your earliest convenience and to get to know you personally in July. Yours faithfully, Esther Meyer  [SEP]  Dear Kim, thanks a lot for your long letter! It was great to hear from you again after such a long time. You asked me, how the pop concert was like which I told you I was going to go to in my last letter. Well, let me tell you, it was just awesome! My job was it, to help to keep all the little kids out of the backstage area. Therefore I got to stay backstage all the time and to see all the members of the ""Backstreet Boys"". And, you won't believe it, I actually got to talk to Nick Carter! Yes, that was the best thing about the concert but I actually just enjoyed the whole experience  to be part of the crew. I sort of felt, like I had done my part to make the concert a sucess. Do you know, what I mean? Anyway, I've got to study now, we've got a maths exam tomorrow. Hope to hear from you soon Lots of love, Esther ",38.0
586," Dear Helen Ryan, Thank you for the information, that I won the competition. I'll try to answer your questions. I would preffer travelling in July, I have only these time, because my summer holidays  during these days. To your answer  about living in tents or cabins, I would like to sleep in a tent. A cabin remember me too much to my home and is too confortable, that isn't what I want to have if I live in a wild area. My favourite sports are climbing and surfing, I'm very good at climbing but for surfing I need some practise. Yes, I have some questions on clothes, what should I take with me and how much money will I need? I hope, I was able to answer your questions and you will perhaps soon give me a reply on my ones. Yours, Vadim Titov  [SEP]  Dear Kim, You can't believe what I did last month. I was given the opportunity to build up the concert and of course I took my chance. First I arrived really early in the morning on the place, but the people were just working and I joined them. My duty was to montage the spot lights on the right places, but it wasn't just easy. You had always some problems because like not having enough wire or the lamps were broken by the transport. The experience that I made was, that I had never worked in a such perfect team. I was able to ask anybody, and he answered detailly, althoug he was full of work. After the hard work we took cool drinks, sat down on the ground and enjoyed the pop concert. And as the pop stars thanked us for our hard job we all were a little proud to be here. Love, Vadim ",27.0
916," June 13th, 2000 Dear Mrs. Ryan, I am writing concerning the journey I have won in your competition. First of all I will try to answer your questions. For me it is only possible to go to the USA in July. The reason for this is that I have to work in August and from September to June I have to go to school. I would prefer  long cabins and I hope that then I will have enough place for all the things I will carry with me. The activities you offer are really interesting. I would like to take part in a painting course and I would like to get to know how to handle a camera. Unfortunately, I do not have an own camera. In spite of this, I have got all  equipement I need for the activity painting and I am painting very well. Could you please tell me if I will need some extra money for the two activities. Secondly, I want to know if I should take any warm clothes with me. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  13th June 2000 Dear Kim, It was nice to hear from you recently. I am writing to tell you about my work at the pop concert. I went there a 10 o'clock in the morning. Then a young man told me what to do. First of all I had to carry all the bottles into the bar and later I helped some other people to get the instruments in the right position. It was really hard work. At one o'clock I had a break. At this time I promised  that I would never do this awful job again. The food was deligious and fortunately I do not had to pay for it. In the afternoon I was sitting around, waiting for the pop groups. Then at five o'clock my favourite band ""Tristania"" arrived. I talked to them and to many other groups that arrived later. In the end I was happy that I had done this job. It was really a wonderful day. I think it would be a good idea if we two did this job together the next year. Give my regards to your family.

244," Dear manager of the Circle Theatre, Last night, I cam to your musical show, ""Over the rainbow"" and I was very disappointed because it wasn't  what you writed in your advertisement. For example, your advertisement said that the starring were Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, but at the show they were not them! They were Kevin Starr and Jessica Richmond. For me, this a big mistake. This event was not the only one because another problem was the respect of the time. Your advertisement said that the show will start at 19:30 PM, but it has started at 20:15 PM. I don't like to have such big change in time. The third problem was that it was writting that the discounts were available, but when I get there it was not true. The fourth problem was that the theatre restaurant was supposed to be open after the show, but once again it was a lie because the restaurant was closed for renovation. After that, I can tell you that I spend the worst evening in all my life at your show and that one more time your advertisement lied about ""You will have a perfect evening!"" After all these explanations, I am sure that you will understand that I would like to have my money back and that I was disappointed last night. So I wish to hear soon about you. Yours sincerly Leia Beroni  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed your daily life? Modern technology, such as computer, car and other else, changed my life in many different ways like communication, traveling and working. For example, a car, which is used from everyone everyday, changed my daily life in the sens that I don't need my dad or my mum to go to ice-skating or to go to work. I can do it by myself and for me it is important not only because of the technology, but because I can show that I am responsable. With this car I can see the world, not exactly, but I can travel and visit other countries that Switzerland. Another  technology that changed my life is the computer because you can do many things with it like homeworks, works, photos, but the most important at my eyes is the communication with my friends from different parts of the world by the web. This  a big walk in the technology and I can say that it is the most important for me because I like to have a lot of friends. So I spend almost one hour every day on the web. At last  technology that I would like to bring out is the TV. This is a good one because you can see what is happening around you and everywhere else on Earth. Naturally technology is everywhere even in the kitchen, for example a special plate or  else, and I could talk a lot about them, but I think that the one  here  are the most important in the change of my daily life .

133," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing in connection with the musical show I saw in your theatre a week ago. Although the show was supposed to be the London's newest and best musical show, I am rather disappointed with it. Firstly, I was really looking forward to seeing Danny Brook and Tina Truelove on the stage. However, you changed actors without informing  viewers. As if this were not enough, the show was forty five minutes late. Your leaflet was rather misleading on this subject. According to your leaflet, tickets were supposed to be a bit cheaper, but I was refused being given a discount. On top of everything, the theatre restaurant was closed. You can imagine how disappointed I must be to spent such an imperfect evening. I demand a full refund or I will be forced to take this mater further. I look forward to receiving your prompt reply. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Recently, we have had a very interesting discussion about how science and technology affects our lives. My life has also changed as a result of modern technology. Thanks to computers, phones, mobile phones,  internet I can communicate with other people faster than I was able to do before. My father is a sailor and I meet him only four times a year. But thanks to mobile phone I can contact him even if he is sailing in the Atlantic Ocean. I also enjoy shopping through  internet. This way I don't have to do be queuing in shops and supermarkets and I can choose fashionable clothes. In the future I would love to be a doctor, especially a cardiologist. Nowadays, modern technology is used in medicine more often and it can minimise the risk of the death of the patients. However, I can see some disadvantages of technological progress. First of all, I spend too much time indoors playing  computer or watching TV. I know that if I want to keep fit and stay healthy, I must take up some sport. Moreover, modern technology has made our environment more polluted. That's why we should abandon cars from city centres,  closed down factories which produce too much sewage. Although modern progress has made our life easier, it may be also harmful. We should all be aware of these consequences of modern technology and use it considerably. ",34.0
857," Dear Ms Ryan, I am the person who won your competition and I am writing in reply to your letter. First of all, I can travel only in july because that is the only time when I am free from my examinations. I prefer staying in a tent as I am used to it and find it more comfortable. The two activities I would like to do in the camp are swimming and photography. I am a good swimmer and I had some expirience in photography however I have very much to learn. Finally, I have got two questions to ask you. How much money and  clothes should I take with me? I am very grateful for your prize and looking forward to visiting the camp. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  I think that bits from the whole school day should be filmed. This will show how the school lives. In the morning prefects make sure that everybody is awake and already up. At the assembly students are told about changes in the timetable and activities for the whole day. In the computing department student learn about informational technologies. The main job of the head of the computing department is not to teach but to keep the computers working properly. Maths is the most popular subject in the school. Mathematics teachers do  great deal of work and have almost no time to prepare lessons. In the chemistry lab experiments are often set up. The teacher looks after the pupil while they are investigating the topic of the lesson. Meals are very important. Kitchen staff works hard to provide students with  variety of food. The video can be finished with a view of the school from outside. ",35.0
249," Dear Sir/Madam, I have just returned from my holiday in London. During my stay I went to see a musical show in the Circle Theatre and I have  very disappointing evening. Firstly I expected Danny Brook and Tina Truelove but I felt very angry when I saw diffrent actors. What is more you advertize there were discounts available but it were not. You said that the musicial show started at 19.30 but recently it began at 20.15. I was very bored because I did not have anything to do when I was waiting for your show. Additionally I felt very hungry and uncomfortable because your theatre restaurant was closed and you did not give us any reason why. You promised us a big show and  perfect evening but it was only an average show with unknown actors. In my opinion you are not very respectful and responsible. I will never trust you again. I would like you give me my money back as soon as possible. I am looking foward to hearing from you. Your faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. As I remember I have known her for ever. She had always been my best friend and I had said her everything. We lived in the same street and the weekends we spent together. When I had 16 years old I fell in love with the most hundsom boy in our school. Paul was older than me and he was playing basketball. Only Pat knew about my lover. One day he invited us for his party. I was very happy and nervous. Everything was great. But when Pat drank some beer she told him everything about me. Everybody started to laught at me. I was angry and I run away to the forest. 'She was my best friend, how can she do it to me' - - I was crying. When I was walking through the forest I saw a very tall man who was staying in front of me. 'My name is Jon' - he whispered - 'Don't be afraid'. We started to talk. This alien was so intelligent and funny that I forgot about my troubles. We talked for all night and I fall in love with him. We met again and again and now Jon is my husband. Maybe it was good that Pat was so talkative. ",27.0
681," Dear Sir/Madam I am so pleased to know that I have won such  amazing prize in your competition. I  like to answer the questions you request from me. Firstly, I should say that I would like to travel in July because of this is the month wich I could more likely have off at work for going on holiday. Secondly, I would prefer to stay at  log cabins rather than  tents. That is because I do not want to seem fuzy but I like to have some comodities when I am going on holiday and I think slepping over the floor without electricity it may annoy me. Finally, I  like to choose swimming as  activity in the Camp. I love swimming and also I should say that I am very good at this sport because I have been doing that for  long time. On the contrary, painting is an activity wich I have never tryied before, so that I have not any skill in drawing but I  like start doing that know when I have the chance. So that is my second choice. On the other hand, I would like to know some imformation wich could be useful in my holiday like: which type of clothes could be more suitable for me in the Camp? Could I need some extra money? Do I need to bring something else? If is so, please let me know as soon as possible. to look forward to getting your Reply Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear friend. I am writting to tell you about my experience in the last month pop concert, where I was helping my friend Nick who was the bouncer of the place. That was a pop concert with lots of famous singers like Madona, Julio Iglesias, and people like them That was a charity concert to save money to poor people of AFRICA. My job it was to accomodate to the people of the main sit of the theathre. Of course those places were reserved just for people well-knowed who wanted to help by joined the concert. So I had to ask them for their identifications and for their invitations. After that, I have to take them to their respective sit. At first, I was a bit scare, I mean I was afraid  not be good enough to have a good performance as  assistant; but finally every thing went well. I should say that it was the easiest and more interesting job that I have ever done. I really enjoyed it and also I did not miss the opportunity to ask the artist to take a photho with me. So, I hope to see you earliest to show  all my phothos. I think, it was very cleaver of me to record that moment wich I will never ever forget, and that was the think that I more liked of that experience.

It could be nice for doing two activities while I am at the Camp. I am interested in sports. Especially, I am wonderful at swimming. I have swimmed since I was in primary school. I would like to learn playing golf at the Camp. I have never played golf in my life. Is it possible to learn playing golf, although I am not good at golf? Would you mind giving some answer  whether I need some clothes and money at the Camp? I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I'm sorry that I haven't written to you for a long time. It was nice you wanted to hear about my experience, and I know you're looking for a job which I did. It was a wonderful chance for me. As you know, I love music. Before the concert started, I cleaned the stage for  singers and I gave some drinks to  singers. Finally, I cleaned the stage again. My works were for  singers, so I could meet singers and talk together. Do you know ""Radio Head""? It is my favourite group. I was able to have some signatures of them. It's brilliant, isn't it? Especially, I liked cleaning the stage, because I could stand  a famouse singer's stage and I could feel his enthusiasm, even though I had to clean it. I want to hear about your school life, and your part-time job. I'm looking forward to hearing from you. Best wishes, ",24.0
215," London, 20th may, 2000 Circle Theatre Dear Sir/Madam, I am just writing this letter in order to complain about the musical show I have seen last Sunday at the evening. Firstly, I become very disappointed because of the actor, who was different from  your advertisement, not Danny Brook was starring. Secondly, I was ready at 19:30 time, as you have announced, and I had to stay waiting in front of the theatre until 20:15, when finally the show began. Besides of all, at the end of the Musical, I went to the your Theatre Restaurant, in order of taking a dinner, because I have leaft home without eating and so I was hungry at that time. Thus, you cann't believe what was my disappointment when I noted that it was closed, without no explanation. Finally, I would like to say you that I am asking for  money back, because I had an evening totally despleased, completely different  that you have anouced in your advertisement. So, I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed your daily life? First of all, modern technology have changed my daily life  the last five years more quickly than in the anchient time, or even than a ten years ago. I became to notice the difference in my work, since when all tasks have changed to the computer and I needed to learn how to use that machine. In addition, at the University teachers not accepted  more written tasks done by hand, but only they should be written by  computer. Besides, teachers began asking us  a lot of article  to be copied throught the internet. From that time, I decided to buy my own computer and every day I was improving my knowledge. Firstly I become to write letters and articles, next I learned several computers plays. When I learned how to use  internet, I didn't stop until now. Nowadays, I cann't stay one day without consulting computers communications throught e-mail or  internet. I change corespondecies with all my family by  internet,  my mother and 2 brothers who live in Curitilra City and so with a brother who live in Italy and another who is living in New Zealand. On balance, I can affirm that I couldn't  without this modern technology today. My life wouldn't be the same another time without these progress. ",23.0

I would rather stay in log cabins than tents. I have some pain on my back therefore I can't sleep in the sleeping bag on the ground.

When I first arrived there I was pretty nervous and excited. My friends and I have been taken to the backstage where we met the members of West Life, Elton John and Robie Williams. I even go a bunch of flowers from them with a ""thank you"" letter. What we all did was making many cups of coffees and help to find their missing socks or any other clothings. What I realised was they were not different from any of us but they were called celebreties. I particularly liked listening  their musicians when they played the piano, clarinet, drums, violen etc. Which was unbelievably great and also to be able to meet these famous singers made me realise we can achieve whatever we want.

First of all, I would like to tell you that it was very disappointing for me that the starring was not Danny Brook as your company had published. Moreover, the musical show was said to start at 19:30 but it really started at 20:15. As the show finished later, we decided to eat something at your theatre restaurant but to our surprise, it was closed. As a result, we came back home in order to eat some fast food. An other thing is that there was  any discount available so we spend a lot of money in such a bad show. Before this week ends, I want your company to give me the money back. Otherwise, I will sue your company. I hope this kind of behaviour does not happen again. Your faithfully, Manuela T. Miracola  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.

We went to a place called 'Deli' where we talked a lot about our school, the exams and, as we usually did, about our friends and boy friends. We asked each other a lot of questions but then we started talking about things that had never been talked about with anybody. Such as the most important thing that had happened to us in our life and that kind of secrets... The problem started when I confesed  her that I had fall in love with Larry, who was my cousin's boyfriend. In spite of the fact that I told her to keep it as a secret, she went to my cousin's house and made the retelling of what I had exactly told her.  As a result, my cousin went to my house in order to gave her a detailed description of it. As I solved the trouble with my cousin, I understood why my mother had told me that 'friends' sometimes weren't as you expected them to be. ",28.0

Because of it I believe it is the best date for  travel You asked me about accommodations or Camp California. I would prefer to stay in  tents because I suppose I will have more contact with natural things than in  log cabins.

I worked as a receptionist in the Vip room and I needed to look very happy during all  time, what wasn't very difficult. You will can't believe how many famous people I known. I met Madonna and could talk with her for ten minutes. It was a dream and she was amazing with me. I didn't tell you, but I helped in this concert just by a chance. A friend of me gave up one week before and asked me if I would like to go in his place. I said ""yes"" and I am sure it was the best decision of my life. Of course I was very tired at the end of five days because of some stressed situations. However, these days were unforgatable to me. Hope to hearing from you soon With best wishes, Rui ",28.0
454," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to complain about the musical show, which gave me a very disappointing evening, while I was staying in London. Firstly, there was a different actor instead of the famous actor, Danny Brook. That made me so disappointed. Secondly, I suppose the show will start at 19:30, but it started t 20:15. It caused me missed the train and I went back to the hotel  nearly in the mid-night. Another problem is, I realised that the discounts were available. However, there wasn't any discount. Additionally, the advertisement said I can visit the threatre restaurant after the show. When I arrived, it was closed. That is so annoying that everything had been changed without any notice. I expected to receive the money back within these two days. Otherwise I would like to take the other action. Your faithfully, Silvie.  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrects.

I told Pat that my father and mother were going to seperate. I told her because I wanted somebody to share my feeling. May be it was a wrong decision to tell her, she began to spread that secrect to everybody including the teachers. They tried to contact with my parents. My parents were very angry when they realised what happened. All my friends were trying to kept a distance with me. That was all because of Pat.

It was very disappointing for me that the actor wasn't Danny Brook, how it was told in the advertisment. It was also told that the evening shows are starting  19.30, but it started 20.15. I had to buy a £20 ticket because discounts were not available. After the show I wanted to go to the theatre restaurant with my friends, but it was closed because of  illness.

I hope you will answer my letter and correct the problems in your theatre. Yours faithfully Adolf Schmidt  [SEP]  At first you have to define what is meant by 'modern technology'.

But are they are usefull in every situation and everywhere? My oppinion is that modern technology can help you to save time. In my case for example my car is very time-saving. If I want to go to training I need not wait for the bus, and so I need not start one and a half hour before training I start a half hour before. So I save one hour, which I can use for other hobbies or for homework or something else. The same problem with mobile phones, if I got one I needn't go to the public phones, I save time. If I  got  Internet I can send e-mails, I needn't go to the letter box, I save time. In my daily life I can save time, but I think every body should use  his saved time for things like hiking, walking, swimming, for a ""natural life"" and not for a life in a technical world with stress and sorrows because we are humans and not robots. We should also move our body and not only use our brain. ",35.0
684," 13th JUNE 2000 Dear Miss Helen Ryan, I am really glad for reciving the first priec in your competition, I will be very plesant joining the holliday. According to your first question, I would like to travel only at July because it is my school holliday so I would not miss any class. I rather prefer to stay in tents because I like to stay as closest as possible to nature, it makes me feel better. As a regard for activities I would choose singing and surfing, surfing because it is my favourit sport, I have been surfing since I was a child so I am pretty good on it, and singing because I really love it, I am not as good on singing as I am on surfing but I like doing it. I would like to ask about somethings which might be necessary for me to take with , like what kind of clothes should I take, should I take my own surf board, and what about money, should I bring some with me? I am looking forward to hear from you. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  13th JUNE 2000 Dear Kin, As you know, I had a great experience last month giving a helping hand for the band called RAMONES. It was a breeze to help them and was very cool as well, those guys really know how to play rock. I had only to stay behind the drummer suppling them with water whenever they wanted. When the band had just started to play, lots of girls started to jump the faints getting very close to them, some of the girls started to take their clothes of, which was the best part for me, but some of  securities went there and took them away. Afterwards, the Ramones had a short break and when they went back from their break they've just went of. I had a really nice time with them even tought I would've prefered to stay at the front with the others people, but anyway it was a great experience for me, I holp to be able to help them next year. I holp you've enjoed my experience, and I hope to hear from you soon. See yah mate ",33.0
153," Dear Sir, or Madam, Your advertisement for the musical show, Over the rainbow, said it was London's newest and best musical show, I agree with that because it is a wonderfull show but, it said that Danny Brook would be starring in it. I was really excited, but it turned out to be a different actor and I thought that was quite disappointing. The show started at 20:15 when it actually should have started at 19:30. While I was waiting I thought I should inform myself about the discounts available, the shocking thing was there weren't any! On the advertisment it also said, you could visit our restaurant after the show, and that is what I did, but when I got there it was shut for no reason. What I'm trying to say is that this wasn't my perfect evening out and that I should get at least some money back! Yours Faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. As we know, Carla and Pat were good friends so Carlotta would tell Pat anything. This time she told Pat that she thought her dog, Churls, was going to die. Pat couldn't resist herself and told her brother Jacob, he was quite shocked about the news because, he missunderstood. He understood that 'Carlotta wants to kill Charles but she is still thinking about it.' Jacob runs as fast as sound to get to Charles's house. There, Jacob aproaches to him slowly and tells him. ""Charles, you can't be with Carlotta anymore, she's evil."" Jacob whispers ""What, you're crazy."" Charles responds. ""She said she was going to kill you!"" Jacob shouts. ""I'll talk to her."" Charles exclaims. When Charles told Carlotta what he knew, Carlotta started crying. It was all a missunderstanding. They managed to sort everything out and Carlotta never had anymore secrets. ",32.0
86," Dear Sir, Last week I stayed in London for  holidays. During my stay in that beautiful city, I thought it was a good idea to go to the theatre to enjoy a Musical show, so I decided to go to your theatre to see ""over the Rainbow"". It was a very disappointing evening not just for me but for most of the people who was in the theatre. First of all, I was looking forward to see one of my favourite actors, Danny Brook, and it was very disappointing for me to see a diferent actor instead of him in spite of his name was writen in the advertisement. In the advertisement for the show I also read that it was going to begin at half past seven p.m. but, in fact, it began at eight fifteen. I also, found out that no discounts were available. In spite of it was said in the advertisement . Another disappointing thing I found was that the restaurant was closed because the cooker has had an accident with hot water when he was boiling some vegetables. In the advertisement there's no mention about getting any money back but I think it was such a disappointing evening that you should give it back to me. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Last summer, I was spending my holidays in a little village in the southern cost of Spain with my friend Pat. We usually went to the beach to have a bath and to enjoy the fantastic whether in that part of Spain during the summer. One day we found out a beautiful little beach next to the big one where some people were taking a sunbath and some children were playing football in the sand. At it was so beautiful, we decided to come back to the beach at night to see the moon, the see and the stars. When we arrived at the beach, we saw a suspicious light and two persons doing something we couldn't see very well. In order to see it, we got closer to them and, at the end, we saw that they had robbed a lot of money and they were trying to put it in a safe place. As it seemed dangerous we agreed that we shouldn't tell it to anybody. It was our secret. Unfortunately Pat explained the story to a friend of us and I don't know how, but the robbers knew that we had seen all they had been doing. So, now we are in danger because of that. ",26.0
1069," Dear Mr. Robertson: I'm writing  you representing all the english class in order to let you know how exciting we are about the trip to London and to give you some ideas of other things we are interresting on doing in London while we're there. First of all, we'd like to thank you for the programme you all ready arrange it's wonderful, because it covers most of our interrests. But also we would like to visit The London Fashion and Leisure show that will be held at the Central kExhibition hall on Tuesday March 14 from 10:00 - 19:00. So we suggest to put it this way on Tuesday 14, in the morning go to the Science Museum and instead of shopping, we could attend the London Fashion show, because  will be the latest fashion, leisure  and sports wear, make up, and hair styles, and as you know us, we love all those topics, and it's a great opportunity while we are  London. Thank you for your time, and We're looking forward to hearing from your opion. faithfully yours  [SEP]  IT WAS DANGEROUS, BUT I KNEW I HAD TO DO IT ...BECAUSE Since always I'd gotten the idea of travel abroad and experiece others people's life and cultures, so I decided to go to Paris as soon as I finished university. I arrived in Paris for New Years Eve 2000 without a place to stay, not speaking any French, alone and with a little amount of money. But eventhough all of these desadventages above, I was folling my dreams and objectives and inspite of everything I was going to do it. So suddenly, a week later I found me a job as an au pair, taking care of two little girls that only spoke french at that moment. It took me three months to overcame the languages and after this time the whole familly falled in love with me,  that when they decided to move to London, they invited me and now we all live here and I feel like part of the familly, eventhough It was very hard at the beggining.

634," Dear Helen Ryan, I am writing in reply to your letter in wich you told me I won the first prize. It is the first time I won a prize! As you asked me some questions, here are the answers. It would be very convenient if I could travel in July, because by that time I'll be on my school holidays. If you agree I would like to have a tent as accommodation, because I have never stayed in one and I wonder this might be a great feeling and that this way I will be in a deeper contact with the animals that live in the area. It would be very pleasant if I could join your basketball team, since I used to play it in my school's team and I think I'm pretty good at it. Surfing would be another good option because I have never stepped on a surfboard and I think this is a beautiful sport. I'd like to know about the kind of clothes I should take, if it's cold or hot by this time of the year and if I should bring any money. I have butterflies of excitement and I'am looking forward to hearing from you as soon as possible. Yours faithfully, Carlitos Andrade  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable. Some people usually spend more money than they have and end up broken, with a lot of bills to pay. However, if you don't have those spending sprees very often, shopping can be a pleasant experience and a chance to spend some quality time with your family. Have you ever spent more money than you could in a visit to the shopping center? If you answered no, congratulations. But if you took a deep breath after reading the question, don't worry. Its normal to have spending sprees. Everyone  had or will have one while shopping. But don't be afraid. Going to the shopping centre with you family can be a good experience. It's a moment in that you can talk to your relatives and use this conversation to know more about yourselves. If you are a good observer, it's a great chance to know what your son or daughter would like to have for her birthday or for any other special date. In conclusion, if you go shopping reasonably, have a good time. On the other hand, if you think that you'll be on the red, I'd better stay at home. ",33.0
912," Dear Madame Helen Ryan Competition Organiser I've just received your letter and I thank you very much indeed for that. I didn't expect to win the first prize in your competition, I am very happy. It was always my dream to spend two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. Now it's become a reality. If I can choose the period, I would like to travel only in July because in other months I have a lot of thing to do. As accommnodation at Camp California, I would prefer to stay in  log cabins because I think it is safier than in a tent. I've red that I will have a chance to do two extra activities while I will be at Camp. I think it would be a good idea to practise my photography, because I'm not so good a photographer and I would like to learn swimming as I can't do it. Taking part in these two activities would be very useful for me. There is another thing I would  know, what kind of clothes have I bring with me? And how much money can I take with me? I'm looking forward to hearing from you. Your sincerely -  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable. This is true. Some days ago my class had a big discussion about shopping. In that occasion I hadn't the opportunity for giving my opinion about this task. Now, my English teacher has asked me to explane all what I think. In my opinion, nowdays, shopping is very easy and in the same time very hard. It is very easy because there are a lot of things to buy, shops are plenty of every kinds of things. You can chose the price more suitable for you. Choosing from a lot of things and choosing the prices too are very enjoyable for me. Shopping is not enjoyable when you have not enough money to buy what you want, or when you are not sure about what you would like to buy. I remember very well two people who thought very different about shopping. My grandmother thought that shopping was a terrible thing, she hadn't enough money to buy even the bread. My mother, whereas was very keen on shopping  everything. ",28.0
1015," Dear Mr Robertson, Thank you for organising the school trip in London. I am really looking forward to participating in the programme, especially the visit to the National Art Gallery. However, I am writing to make a suggestion about the trip on behalf of all the students in my class. Could I suggest that you consider changing the programme? The London Fashion and Leisure Show is going to take place on 14th March in the Central Exhibition Hall in London. According to the advertisement I have seen, it is supposed to show the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles. It is also free to enter for students. It might be a good idea to fit this visit in in the afternoon on 14th March because I strongly believe that it would stimulate our interests in London so that we could study English with strongest motivation. Even if we do not have enough time for shopping after the show, we will be able to go shopping at a free time on 15th March. I sincerely hope this letter will be of some help. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  I believe that famous people, such as politicians and film stars, deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time for some reasons. First of all, they are the same as ordinary people even if they are treated as celebrity. Therefore, they should deserve to lead a normal life as we do. Secondly, noone has the right to look at anyone's private life even if they are journalists. Some people might say that we all have the right to know everything happening in the world as one of the human rights. However, I think that they mix them up and that they should think about the right of privacy. To sum up, famous people are the same as we are, and we all have the right to lead a private life and no right to break into their privacy. Therefore, I strongly believe that famous people deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time. ",38.00
840," Dear Mrs Ryan, I am very glad to hear that I have won first prize in your competition. Here are some further information you need from me: I would like to travel in July. It is the only time of the year I have two weeks holiday. I would be grateful if you could give me a log cabin. It is more secure and there is no problem if it rains. As for the two activities, I would enjoy climbing and playing tennis. I have been climbing for more than 7 years. It should not be a problem. On the other hand, I have never played tennis in my life. But I watch every tournament on television. I like this sport very much. I would like to know if I need  special clothes, extra money or any other things. Could you please send me more details about that... I look forward to hearing from you. Charline Cholmondeley  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable. There are two kinds of shopping; the first one is shopping for fun. You often see young ladies looking for the nicest dress, the most beautiful shoes and so on... They are all excited when thinking about the party they have been invited to. This is very nice when you can do your shopping like that. The second kind of shopping is not enjoyable. It is when you have to buy what is necessary for you: bread, butter, milk etc... It is always the same. You have to find the best article for the best price. You are among thousands of people, but at the same time, you are alone. Besides, when you want to pay for the things you have taken, you can believe that the ladies behind the cashdesks are unable to smile. After that, you have to carry your bag (of course far too heavy for you) to your car. When you are at home, there is no reward except that your husband or your children notice that the fridge is full again. Shopping is annoying but also necessary, it is why it is not always enjoyable.

517," Dear Mr I'm writing to complain about what it happened  me two days ago, during you musical show ""OVER THE RAINBOW"". A friend of mine went to see it the last May. He told me to go because the actor's performance was good. So I decided buying a ticket, but no discounts were available. Then with my disappointing I noticed that there was  different actor instead of Danny Brook. Nobody informed me about it. And why did the show start at 20:15 instead of 19:30? After the show, my friends and me decided to go to your restaurant, but we were amazed to find it close. In conclusion, I ask for my money back because it wasn't a perfect evening like your advice showed. I hope that you understand me. Awaiting your reply, Your faithfully  [SEP]  It's true that modern technology has changed our daily life. In the pass, for example, we used to write letters to comunicate, but now we surely send an e-mail, a fax or make a phone . Certainly it will be easier and faster than write, but it was nice when you were waiting for a letter. Nowadays, you have all things immediatly and soon, but will it  be  good ? I think no. Everyone have to use modern technology carefully, because too much technology could be dangerous. It couldn't allow us  to think and to do freely. Today there are children that don't know nothing about nature and its things. Probably, because their parents haven't enough time to go out the city and show them nature. So they prefer leave their sons wecting TV. Modern technology? Yes, but we mustn't loose the values and our free time to stay with our family. ",23.0
419," Dear Sir/Madam I am writing to express how I was dissatisfied with OVER THE RAINBOW which was presented by the Circle Theatre. First of all, the reason why I bought the ticket was Danny Brook, who is my favorite star, and was going to play for the show. However, there was a different actor instead of him, and this was most my disappointment. Moreover, as your advertisement, we would get  discount price for the ticket, but it was not available. Although the show was supposed to start at 19=30, it started at 20=15, so I had to wait for an hour. To make matters worse, because of the late starting, the theatre restaurant had already closed after the show finished. I wonder if you could give me a refund for that, because the show was extremely different  which I was expected. I hope you would take immediate action for that. I look forward to hearing from you in the future. Yours faithfuly  [SEP]  Our daily life with modern technology Science and technology are necessary for our life. I could say that we can not servive without them. Nowadays,  especially computer technology is improving, therefore, we can get any kinds of information as much as we require. It is getting more convinient and useful than our past life. Further more, it is possible to cure many patients who have serious desease more effectively, if we use modern technology for medical science. However, if we rely on modern technology too much, it is difficult to be independent, otherwise we will tend to not consider or solve a problem by ourselves. From my point of view, it is great that science and technology improve for our life. Because of convinience, we can spend  time more effectively, but we should not be rely on these  too much. ",25.0
1066," Dear Mr Robertson, I am writing to you first of all to thank you about the good programme that you give us about the trip in London, especially for planning to visit the science museum, which we believe is going to be very interesting. However, we have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and we would like to suggest to including this point in the programme. The show is going to be on Tuesday the 14 of March from 10.00 to 19.00 and we fained it very interesting, because we will have the opportunity to see mews, firstly about the latest fashions, secondly concerning leisure and sports wear and finally about make up and hairstyles. In addition of this, it is going to be a great opportunity for all of us, because for the students it is completely free. We were thinking that meaby we can go early to visit the Science Museum and than go to the Central Exhibition , where the event is going to have place! We really look forward to receiving your answer as soon as possible! Thank you very mutch! Your sincerely,  [SEP]  We have been talking for hours in our class about the treatment of the media regarding famous people. Of course I must agree with the opinion of my class - mates: famous people, such as actors, singers or politicians, deserve to have a private life, but of course it is not always like this! Almost the time they have journalists following them everywhere and all the time, looking for  great news or interesting pictures to put on the first page of the newspaper, and I don't think this is very nice, but  is the price that famous people have to pay, just becouse they are popular. Anyway, this is not always necessary a problem, but it can be a big thing for the famous person, becouse  let people talking about him and increase his popularity. In conclusion, I can say that this is not the bigger problem that the world has and -- it is not my problem becouse I am not famous! ",29.00
311," Dear Sirs We are writting to you to complain about the musical show ""Over the Rainbow"",  we saw last week in your Theatre. We have spent a week's holiday in London and wanted to see a musical show. We read an advertisement about your musical show, starred by the well-known Danny Brook and Tina Truelove in a local newspaper We were very disappointed to hear that the actor was replaced by other  at the last minute. The advertisement said that it starts at 19.30, but it started actually at 20:15 due to the probleme of the sound. We were also surprised to discover that the student discounts wasn't available for us, because they didn't accept our student indentity card from Switzerland. We were very frustrated to read on the door of the theatre restaurant ""Close due to holidays"" specially when we were very starving. This evening was a waste of time. So we asked you for our money back. I  looking forward to hearing from you soon. Yours Sincerely  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed your daily life? Could you figure out how your life will be without all the modern technology? What is the effect of it  in your environement? Were the people happier in a past than to day? If you are interested in the question, you will be interested by this article. Nowadays, the technology takes  a large place in your daily life and improves the speed of the achievement. For example at work, we look on the computer screen all day, sending e-mail at the other side of the world, doing some searches etc. We gain a lot of time with  computer, but if your computer brooks down, you couldn't do anything because everything is on it. The technology moves very fast specially in the domaine of transportation. The cars are able to reach 300 km per hours speed and are more reliable than in the past. The major probleme for the industry cities is to deal with the bad effect of polution in the environement. A lot of money are involved in research to stop the increasing   of polution. To sum up, all the improvements have a price to pay; The condition of the environement. We are too reliable at technology today. But we can ask us ""What will be happen in 50 years? Our children will be able to travel in the moon as we travel to Japan? ",24.0

This building have a hundred floor and it takes for five minutes  from the grand to the top in the elevator. There are many facilities which are a museum, a exhibition and many gift shops where we might also enjoy going shopping.

929," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to say how happy I am to be able to take part of ""Camp California in the USA"". I would like to inform you that I am able to go there only in July. I am finishing my study in June, then I have a month off (July) and on August 1st I am starting a new job. I would prefer to live in a tent during your camp. I have always dreamt about sleeping in a tent, in sleeping bags, but my parent always took me to expensive hotels, so it would be a nice adventure for me. During the camp I would like to pratise my swimming (I have attended swimming lessons for 3 years) and also I would like to learn how to do some good photos. (I have no experience!) I would be really glad if you could tell me something about clothes I should bring with me. (Do I need any special garments?) and could you tell me please, if I need some extra money to pay for anything like trips or photo-paper. I am looking forward to hearing from you Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Shopping could be fun! Sometimes I like doing it during long Sundays. I like going between colourful shelfs and picking some nice things for dinner or for decorating our house with. I love talking with my mum during shopping, meeting new people or old friends. Sometimes unfortunatelly shopping could be very annoying, especially at Christmast or Easter time. Then, all shops and supermarkets are crowded. People are trying to buy as many things as they can, and everyone wants to be first to the check-out - you have to wait ages to get there! People are pushing each other, they are not as kind as usually. You have to be more careful and hold your bag tightly because this is a good period for all thieves (they know they can steal something without having been seen!) At Christmas or Easter time all shops have usually an unpleasant smell (because of the crowd) and are very noisy! Another period when I don't like doing shopping is when there is a huge sale! I always go absolutely crazy when I have to do shopping then! You cannot breath, you cannot see anything apart from a bulk of shouting women and men who want to get something cheaper! Next,  not very enjoyable thing about shopping is spending money! When I go to the big supermarkets I always spend more than I was going to. You just cannot refuse buying another bottle of body lotion or another box of soap because they smell so nice can you?! I always become very angry with myself afterwards, but I cannot help it. In my opinion, shopping could be really enjoyable! The only advice would be: ""Do not do your shopping at Christmast or Easter time"" - but it will not make any sense, will it? So you just have to get used to it, and enjoy your shopping for the rest time of the year! ",36.0
822," Dear Helen, Thank you very much for your letter telling me about the first prize. It seems so exciting. I really look forward to taking part at Camp California. I would like to travel in July because my examination will be finished on June 15th. And I have a plan to go to visit my parents in Bangkok, Thailand, in the middle of August. So, I think July is the best time to go for the Camp. In addition, the weather may be nice at that period of time. For accommodation, I would prefer tents because I get used to it. Because I'm not good at sporting, so I will choose singing and photography as my activities. When I was studying in the university I joined the Photo Club where I got the knowledge a well as a wide variety of knowhow in taking photo. As I love singing and always spend my free time in Karaoke to practise, I think my singing is not too bad. I also have a couple of things to ask you. What type of clothes and how much money do I need to prepare? I would be delightful if you could recommend me. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  ""Shopping is not always enjoyable"". I strongly agree with this sentence. I used to do shopping a lot when I was in the university. I was 19 years old but I spend over 200 pounds in some weeks just to make myself up-to-date all the time. I bought lots of new fashion clothes, bags and shoes. Four years in the university I never had  saving money. Now, I hate shopping because I spent a lot when I was young as mentioned so it came to the conclusion that shopping is a way to waste the time and money. I found that it's not worth when I went to the southern part of Thailand 3 years ago where I met an old man and his little grandson. They are very poor. The money that I spent on shopping can help them a lot if I would not do it before. Little grandson tried to help his grandfather who was 70 years old by hiring himself out as a gardener after school, though he was only 10 years old. This thing tell me shopping is not enjoyable any more. ",31.0

I decided to see the 19:30 show so I arrived on time at 19:00 o'clock. I went to buy the ticket and as I like to enjoy the show near of the stage I bought a £20 tiket but when I asked for the discount they told me ""I am sorry but there was an error in the advertisement, It will be impossible to make you a discount"". This was my first problem. At 19:15 I was very impatient waiting for the show begins and a man anounced that the show will start at 20:15. I had to wait more that an hour outside the theatre because to make matters worse I couldn't spend the time in the theatre restaurant. The reason they gave me  it was closed because it was being repaired. Finaly the show started and to my sorprise my favourite actor Danny Brooke had been replaced by another actor. Now what I hope is you refound me my money, it was a horrible evening out Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. I would be the best party of the year. Last month was my grandmother birthday and I organised a party for her. My grandmother loves the parties and when she was young she used to organise big parties for all the family and friends. Now she is 85 years old so she can't do that but, I can. I organised everything like: the place, the food, the decoration, I sent letters by post to everybody she knows. It seems  to be the bigger party of her life. I thought she could have a show in this special party so I talked to Pat, my best friend,  if she could help me as she works in the production of T.V. programes. She loved the idea and said she had differents shows so  to decide which could be the most suitable. I told her to make me a phone cold. Pat sent to my house a fax with the different alternatives she thought  but unfortunately my grandmother was there and she saw the paper so the sorprise was ended. But after all the party was great.

69," Dear Miss Clark, I have recently taken part in your International Arts Festival. I enjoyied it and here are some feelings and advice for next year. First of all, it was a great idea to put together different countries to organise this Festival. However, there were only artists from six countries, not  as written in your add. Then I had  pleasure  listening to your variety of concerts. Each one was fantastic and fill in with euration, but I'd appreciate more place, because unfortunately some concert halls were too small! You certainly saw that  plays and films had a lot of success. So, I wanted to know if there will be more films next year. It could be an advantage! An other excellent thing was your choice for the entry. That was a great idea to have just one ticket for all events. That was simpler than an other way of selling tickets (practical and attractive). Finally, I want you to make a suggestion for next year. It would be better if people have had the possibility to let their cars very near to the Festival during the week-end! I am sure you'll pay attention to my suggestions and advice and I am looking forward to seeing you next year. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Mark and his family decided to go for a walk in the Alps. So, her father prepared the car and her mother took some food for the journey. That was a Sunday and, as always, Mark was very excited. He was very keen on going in the mountains. Suddenly, the father stopped and said: ""Here we are!"" They were near a little house, built in wood and began walking. The sun was shining and Mark was really happy to be outside with his family. They ate with the owner of the little house, whose name was John. It was very quiet because they were in  nature; they could just hear  cows and John's two dogs. Mark was very interested in building small things with John. He was able to make different objects in wood. After that, marks father who had fluent traditional Swiss language spent time with an old woman he had just met near the house. After eating old cheese and Swiss chocolate, that was high time Mark's family went back home. Mark was such happy but very exhausted to recognize this story nevertheless this story happened a long time ago. ",27.00
18," Dear Mrs Clark, I am writing to you because, as one of the visitors of the International Arts Festival which took place two weeks ago in our city, I would like to let you know some of my opinions - and suggestions, as well - related with what I saw in the festival and what I could not see, but I would have liked to find. First of all, I must congratulate the people responsible of this good idea. It is known of all the lack of art festivals and cultural activities in general that shows our city. And what a belter thing to solve this than to give the festival an international character. But including only six countries in the festival does not seem enough, in my opinion. I think next year you should invite more different countries, because the festival would be more multicultural. Secondly, there were some problems of accommodation in the classical concerts because some concert halls were too small. Another important thing is that, despite the number and quality of films, there were, from my point of view, not many plays. In addition, I would like to talk about the success among most visitors of the weekend ticket, due to its economical price and because of its comodity in use. Finally, I would like to suggest that, in next year's festival, you include different kinds of music, as ska or ethnical music. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Who doesn't want to earn some money? The topic says that young people have a lot of problems, but without any doubt, money is one of the most important of them. If you still don't have economical freedom from your parents and your studies don't permit you to have a full-time job, these are some suggestions that maybe will help you. One possible thing is to display in a public place what you can do best, and, then, ""sell"" it to the people. For example, you can   dance folk be Hamlet in the street, or even sing with some of your friends a nice song from you country. You must be aware, anyway, of the difficulty of this kind of things (bad weather, no attention from the people and so on) But maybe you are too shy to do this. In this case, you can cook some cakes and sell them near a school or in the centre of the city, as well as other traditional products: cheese, honey ,chocolate... Another thing that can be useful is to make some pottery or do original paintings and sculptures. You don't need to be a Picasso, it's enough with a bit of imagination. If you don't feel like doing any thing of this, you have alternative solutions. If you like fishing, you can try to colaborate with the local market or some shops, in order to sell them the fish you can achieve by yourself. Finally, if anything of the above  result, you can prepare the classical parties in discos or work as a babysitter It doesn't matter how, the aim is always money. ",30.00
907," Dear Mrs. Ryan, I am writing  you to give you the suitable information you need about me. but also I would like to thank you for the very nice prize. Here are some of the information: I would like to travel in July because then the school year ends and I will be able to go on vacation. I would prefer to stay in log cabins because I can't sleep outside in a tent. I would be very pleased if I could practice basketball and swimming I am very good at basketball and I am playing in my school's team. I know how to swim and dive from high places. I am very keen on both sports. Of course there are some things that I would like to ask you, if possible, I would like to know what kind of clothes shall I take with me. And finally how much money will I need to have with me. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Thank you again Yours Sincierly,  [SEP]  Dear Kim I'm writing to tell you about my experience last month. You know that last month I helped at a pop concert and I've enjoyed it very much. I did many different kinds of things. First of all I helped with the decoration of the place where the consert would take place. Then I helped the dancers with their dance on stage. After that I helped the singers perform and dance together and finally I helped with the lights for the show. It was amazing! (the show) I had a really great time working with all the pop singers and dancers and decorators I even met some very interesting people with who  made really good friends. What I liked the most was working with the singers, teaching them how to dance and follow some footsteps. This is an experience, I'll never forget. I'm looking forward to hearing from you very, very soon. Your friend ",29.0
1239," Dear Mrs. Smith, I am writing in reply to your enquiry about this year international conference. The conference will be held at The Palace Hotel on Old Street. There will be signs to follow from  Central train station. The conference is commensing on 31st June 2001 from 10.00-15.00. Light lunch will be provided. After the conference, there will be a relaxing party. There is no dressed-code for the party. However I suggest you could wear the same outfit as you wear for the conference. I have included the local map, there are some ideas at the back of the map. Please let me know if you would like to book one of the city-walk tours, We have arrange spacial discounts for the conference attendance. Personly I recommend the Dicken's tour because it is a good length of walking and very historical. I hope that I have covered all  information you would need and look forward to seeing you. Your sincerely, P.S. Please find the enclosed map.  [SEP]  There are several interesting buildings in the city of London. I believe Liverpool Street Station is at the top  list. The building itself looks grand and elegant. Despite the fact that this building has served half-a million commuters in a day, it  always clean and functional. There are two parts of Liverpool Street Station that make it so interesting  building. The newly decorated section is fairly modern  style with escalators and touched-screen ticket machine. It is also very well linked into the old underground station which it is such a contrast in transformation. The old bit is rather unique and charming. You could really imagine how it looked like in the old day. There is another surprising section in this building. At the far back of the station  is also connected to a spacious well designed pedestrians park. It is a good example of a great architecture that was designed to provide services to the public. Finally, it is in the heart of  city and everyone would be able to find  without doubt. ",32.00
619,"  Dear Ms Helen Ryan I am writing this letter as an answer to your request for some further information from me. I would like to travel in July, because I have recently got a new job, which I am going to start in August. Therefore, July is my last free month until much later. I would prefer to stay in a tent during the camp, as I find tents a lot more exciting than log cabins. I am a very good swimmer, so I choose swimming from the activities you listed. I am also very keen on climbing, although I am not extremely good at it. I would also like to ask how much money I am supposed to take with me and I would be glad if you could give me an answer before the camp begins. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely Bibiana Krol  [SEP]  Most people enjoy shopping. But not me. I think shopping is hard, exhausting work, especially when you are trying to buy yourself some new clothes. The most annoying thing about shopping is that in most cases you have to search for a particular stuff for a long time and visit several shops before you find something that suits you. Eventually, after long seeking you find a skirt you like. But it doesn't fit. You get really angry trying to find a bigger one but unfortunately this is the last one. And finally, after a few more hours, you buy the skirt of your dreams. And suddenly you notice the identical but cheaper one in the next shop. Accident like that can really make you livid. At last you come back home, carrying the most beautiful skirt in the whole town. You phone your friend to visit you and your friend come, wearing the skirt not unlike the one you have just bought. But that's the life. You can always go and buy a new one. ",34.0
329," Dear Sir, According to the evening I have passed in your theatre, I was supposed to see ""Over the rainbow"" (as you wrote on the publicity paper). However, it was absolutely not like you described! First, there was a big late about the time. The show begun 45 minutes later than supposed! To make matter worse, we have never had the oppurtunity to see Danny Brook because, instead, there was a different actor! How can you explain that big mistake? At the top of everything, you proposed us to visit your theatre restaurant after the show. How could we visit this place, if it is not open?! You wrote so persuately that it would be our ""Perfect Evening Out""... I am really disappointed about this experience. I spent £20 - and  not as you wrote  ""discount available"". I will not make troubles but I ask you politely  my money back. I hope, you will agree and share my disappointement. I am looking forward to staying in contact with you. Sincerly yours,  [SEP]  Fashion of the Future Future, Everybody ask how will our world look like. What's about the fashion in 100 years? I think we have to take in consideration our enviroment: The pollution makes more and more the atmosphere warmer. In fact, winterseason will be rare or will maybe even disappear. The ice will smellt, the weather will be warmer. People won't wear warm clothes anymore and they will certenly be sinthetic, because there won't be enough place to cultivite cotton and to let grass sheeps. Community: Another very important point! Electronical community takes more and more pace in our habitual lifestyle. We  see, the objects will come smaller. So small that I can  imagine, they will be introduce (maybe like chips) in our clothes. Our feelings will be transmit electronical through our clothes to other people. I think at  internet. "" Internet on our body"".. I'm shure that is not impossible! Clothes will take a very important place in our future. They will be like a second skin. Or do you think, an icetime will come? ",13.0
166," Dear Sir, I am writing to you because of the latest musical show you played in  Circle Theatre. I am keen on musicals and I have seen many of them in different parts of the world. Unfortunately the one I saw a week ago in the Circle Theatre was one of the worst. Here are some argeuments telling why me and many other people from the audience are so disappointed. First of all the musical should have started at 19.30 but unfortunately we had to wait forty five minutes. It is a wasting of time. Moreover the advertisement for the show says that the main role in the musical plays  great Danny Brook. I must admit I'd been looking forward to see him. In fact at the stage appeared  compleatly different person. Also discounts for tickets wasn't available. After the show together with my friends I went to the theatre restaurant to have a romantic supper, unfortunately it was closed without any sensible reason. At the end of my letter I would like to ask if it is possible to have some money back. I would be very pleased if you answered my request soon. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Besides this little thing she is actually perfect. But to make everything clear I'll start from the beggining. It was two years ago. The school finished and we, I mean Pat, Tim and me, didn't know what to do with plenty of spare time. I didn't wanted to spend that holiday with my parents in the country. I was old enough to go somewhere only with my friends. Tim gave a proposition about going at the sea by his new car. It seemed fantastic but we knew our parents would never agree. We had to find another way out. We planned to tell them that we were going for a summer camp in the mountains where we would practise French. Parents were very pleased and happy we are so ambisious. Of course we didn't wanted to go there, it was just a ""cover"". We prepared tents and other relevant equipment and we were waiting. We promised to keep it in secret. Two days before going Pat was packing her luggage and asked her mother to help her. During  chat Pat mentioned about  sea and her mother found out that something was wrong. Pat started to cry and told about everything. As a result we were grouded for all  holidays and all because  our almost perfect Pat. ",26.0
276," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing this letter to you to show the difference between your advertisement for Over The Rainbow and the real life. When I saw your advertisement on yesterday's newspaper, I thought that I would have a perfect evening as you have written on your advertisement. But now I am thinking that it was a waste of time. I am a fan of Danny Brook and he was one of the reasons why I chose seeing Over The Rainbow, but I didn't even see him on the stage. Moreover it was written  that the musical was between 14:30-19:30. Suprisingly the show started at 20:15. That destroyed all my plans. Then I decided to have a dinner at your Theatre Restaurant after the show, but unfortunately it was closed. I think, all of these disappointments are too much for one evening. After all I am sure that you understood it wasn't my perfect evening out and you will give  my money back. I am looking forward to hearing your good news  Sincerely,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. That was also my fault. I don't know why I told this to Pat. But I thought Pat and I were best friends. Yesterday Larry suggested going to  cinema after school. This was the most wonderful suggestion I have ever had. Going to  cinema with the boy I love. It sounded really good. Of course I accepted immidiately. I was like walking on the clouds  the whole day until I saw Pat running towards me. I suddenly remembered that I promised Pat to help her with her history homework. She came near to me and said ""Ready for this evening? Don't forget bringing your history books."" She was very nervous because she was about to fail. I told her that I want to tell her something. Then I explained what has happened that morning. She was about to cry. ""I see. You choose Larry, but I thought that I was your best friend."" After hearing this, I told her that I am deeply in love with Larry. I told her not to tell this anyone. She said OK angrily. After school Larry and I went to the cinema, but on the enterance there was a beautiful girl waiting for us. Larry told me that she is his girlfriend and then I told them I had to go home. When they asked me the reason I told  that I promised my Mom to be with her. They said OK and I went home. When I closed my bedroom's door I burst into tears. I don't know how long I cried... Next morning I went to school again. Everyone at the school was knowing about my love to Larry including him. Pat was the only person who knew  it. That showed me not to trust anyone. ",24.0
756," Dear Helen Ryan As you mentioned that I have won the competition - two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A.  therefore here is the information that you require. I can travel only in July because during this month I am free to go anywhere, actually it is my summer holiday. Apart from that I wouldn't mind at all whether  to stay in tents or log cabins but if I have to choose between these two I'd prefer to stay in tents because it gives me a nice feeling and relaxation, it is very unusal for me to stay in log cabins while you are camping. The activities that I'd like to do: First one it would be basketball and to be honest I can play it very well due to I used to be a basketball player in my high school. Second activity it would be tennis, I am not the expert in this one because I've played it only twice but I know how to hit the ball and basic stuff like ; serve the ball, back hand and fore hand to hit the ball. Finally I have something to ask you about how many people can stay in one tents? Do I have to bring swimming suit if I want to swim in the camp? How much money do I need and what else do I need to pay ? This information should  enough for you but if you'd like to know more about anything please ask me and do not hesitate. I'm looking forward to it and I hope seeing you during this summer. Your sincerely,  [SEP]  Sometime when you ask your friend especially girls. What would you like to  after the class or during the weekend? The typical answer would be 'I'm going to  shop because I like it even windows shopping would be fine'. However, for me shopping is not always enjoyable. Why? First of all, it's wasting my time especially when I can't find the thing I want, this is very frustrating. In addition, it's so tiring to walk around the place over and over to find the thing you want. Apart from that, it's quite annoying when you have to compare or to survey the price in order to buy the cheapest one, if possible. Once you've got all  your shopping list, you also have to carry all the bags that you just bought which is very heavy sometime. However shopping is not a bad thing, only if you plan it carefully what to buy, where to go, how much money you will spend on? ",25.0
453," Dear manager I am writing  you because of your new musical show ""Over The Rainbow''. I have spent my holiday in London recently and it is like a tradition, we went to a musical. After reading your programme I was very impressed and I was looking forward to see it. But firstly when we bought our tickets, we didn't get any discount, we had to pay the full price. And then the show started at 20:15 p.m., although it was supposed to start at 19:30 p.m., so we've had to wait quite long in this crowded room. And when the show finally started, I realized that it was not Danny Brook acting, instead there was an unknown, not very talented actor. After the show we wanted to go to your theatre restaurant, because we were very hungry, but then we saw that it was closed, because of staff illness. I would like to ask you to give us our money back, because it has been a very disappointing evening for us. Yours sincerely, Sara Schmidt  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. We sometimes tried to make surprise parties, but it never worked because of him. Two weeks before his birthday he started asking us what we were gong to do. That annoyed us so much, that we started making something up. We told Pat we couldn't have a party on his birthday, because everyone except me had something to do. Of course, that wasn't , we had actually organised a party for him with all his friends since a long time go, but he wasn't supposed to know that. On his birthday all our friends were at my place, waiting for Pat. I had invited him to opened the evening with me. But half an hour before he should have been there he phoned me and said he was too tired to come. I couldn't change his mind although I've tried everything. In the end I just told him the truth. He was very sorry that he had not want to come and arrived quite soon then. But I know now, that it is always better not to lie even if it should be for  good . ",33.0
901," Mrs Helen Ryan, I have just received your letter where you stated that I won the first prize of the competition of which I need more information. To begin with, in your letter you asked me when I would like to travell. Well, I would be only available in July, because at that time I would be in  winter holidays. Also, I prefer sleeping in a tent than  in a long cabin because it is easier to clean. You mentioned the chance to choose two activities from you list. I would like to do tennis, because I used to play when I was at school and swiming because I like water sports and because I am good at it. Could you also let me know what kind of clothes and how much money I would have to take. Thanking you in anticipation for your help, I look forward to hearin from you. Yours sincerely, KA.

685," 8 Jun 2000 Helen Ryan Competition Organiser Dear Sir At the begining I would like to thank You for Your letter - it pleased me much. I have always dreamt about holidays 'in Camp California' However there are some problems that I hope to solve. First of all the only suitable time for me to go is July. It is the only time when I am free from my duties - I am a doctor so you see that I can not let my patients down. If we are talking about accomodation then accomodation in tents would be great - I love being close to the nature. I would like You to know also about my two hobbys: swimming and surfing. I am not telling about some kind of achivements in those discipines but It is my big pasion I hope to have a chance to practice both of theme at 'Camp California'. There is also one thing that I would like to ask You about. The question is: Do I need some extra money and what kind of clothes should I take for this trip? Yours sincerely Anna Nowak  [SEP]  Unconected part of every people lifes is shopping. We buy everything from clothes to food and the only thing that could stop us from this are money. As a teenager I must addmit that there is nothing more enjoyable from shopping. It's like ,,walking in the clouds,, you feel like  flaing. Choosing gave me such big pleasure because I never have to worry from vere do I take money for my wishes. It all comes from my parents. All I ought to do is buy and choose. I think that ,,having is a dream'' of all of us. It's hard for me even to emagine the situation when shopping is not enjoyable. Probably it is one of the moments when you want something baddly and you can't have it. Another situation is when you have to buy somebody a present. Everybody know that ,,present presents a problem'' You know your own task but what vith a task of the other person? However I can't agree with  opinion that ,,Shopping is not always enjoyable'' I think that everybody like to buy but not everybody like to see pleasure in it. ",28.0
835," Dear Helen Ryan, I have received your letter: I was very glad to know that I have won two weeks at Camp California. I have to take part in basketball competitions all year long, except during July, so it is the only month in which I can travel. I would be grateful if I could have the accomodation in a log cabin: I would prefer not to stay in a tent because of my height, I am so tall that I could never stand up. I would like to play basketball because my trainer said that it would be suitable not to stop practising it during July. I can play basketball very well I would be grateful if you could teach me to play golf. I have never practised this sport, so I can't play golf at all. Would you mind sending me some information about the kind of clothes I will need? I would like to know how much money you suggest to bring. I would be grateful to receive some information about the meals at the camp and I hope that it will not be a problem for you if I am a vegan. I am looking forward to hearing from you, Yours sincerely, Elena Pabori  [SEP]  I think that if we want to show the good points of our typical school-day, we should film the large number of sport activities that this school organises because students are compelled by them to come to school with enthusiasm. Only  who gets good marks can take part in theese activities, so sport activities are seen as a prize, so while the students are playing basket ball, tennis, volleyball... or they are swimming you can see satisfaction on their faces, and our volleyball team is excellent. It would be nice to film an Ancient Greek Poetry lesson because  Ancient Greek teacher is very good at explaining; she is excellent at catching our attention and she wants everyone to tell the class the impressions and emotion they have reading Saffo, Alceo, Alcmone.... In my opinion we should film  science lesson, so that our teacher, listening to her own statements could realise that they make no sense! ",36.0
973," Cracow 8430 Dear Competition Organiser, I've already decided when I want to take a part at The Camp California in USA. The most suitable time for this trip is only in July, because I've planned already the rest of my summer holidays. On June and August, so that's the only time when I can travel there. An accommodation at the camp that is more suitable for me is in log cabins. I prefer that kind of accomodation because I can have a kitchen or even a bathroom there, but I can't have it in  tent. I've also choosed two activities, swimming and sailing. These are my favorite because they have a lot to do with water, but I like them more than surfing. At the end I would like to ask you how much money is needed and what kind of clothes are the best for this camp.  Please answer me soon. Otto Zajac.  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable I agree with this statement especially when we talk about small shop in the center of a big town. These shops are usually very crowded and you have to wait for a very long time to buy one kilogram of carrots for example. In such a shops there is usually one or one or two sellers, what is not enough when a shop is full of people. That's a place where you lose too much of time and health. Shopping is more enjoyable if you go to a big supermarket, because there is smaller crowd and more sellers work there. In these days people prefere shopping at supermarkets  than at shops or even shopping areas, because shopping at  shop is less enjoyable and you spent the same amount of money. ",25.0
91," Dear Sir or Madam, I'm writting to you to complain about a theatre play I have seen, called: ""Over the rainbow"". This show was for me very disappointing for many reasons: First of all, I was very surprised by the no presence of the famous actor, Danny Brook, who was one of my reasons  to book a sit. Also, I'm unhappy about the bad informations of your advertisement, which clearly says, the play begins at 19.30 instead of 20.15 as my evening' show. At the end of show, unfortunately for me and the others spectators, the worst thing happened: the theatre's restaurant was closed without any reasons  and nobody went to us to apologise or advice us for an other restaurant opened late in the night. That's why, in return of all those problems, I'm asking you to give back some money. I'm looking forward to have an answer from you. Yours faithfully. BOUCHER Jean-Pierre.  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. That's why all his friends were angry against him and let him alone. It was clear that Pat had to change and show to his friend that they can believe in him thrutly. For those next  days, Pat will do his best to be the most sympathic as possible. To beginning, every morning Pat says a pleasant ""hello"" in adding to that a big smail. His mother always says: ""If you are smailing and are nice with the people, the poeple would be nice and would smail to you"". As Pat does always what his mother says his friends began to play again with him, but not just his old friends, every body wanted to play with me. The morality of the story is here very clear: be nice with the people and the people will respect you and will appreciate you as a friend. ",22.0

I would also like to thank you for the good programme you made for us,  especially the river trip to Greenwich might be fascinating. I would like to tell you about the show which we would like to see: It is ""The London Fashion and Leisure Show"", which is going to take place at the ""Central Exibition Hall in London, on Tuesday the 14th March, between 10.00 and 19.00. The latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles will be shown in this occasion. We think that this is a great opportunity because it takes part only once a year and, on top of all , it is free for students. We suggest to go to the show on Tuesday afternoon instead of going shopping (thing that we can do on Wednesday afternoon, in our free time). I hope you will consider our request yours sincerely  [SEP]  I was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. I had absolutely no choice. We had walked for three hours (my mother, my two brother and I) through the humid and noisy jungle, looking forward to reach a small but clean house where a nice and friendly family, old friends of us, used to live. The path we were walking in was quite clean and I was feeling really happy and relaxed... until we reached a river. There were nor  bridge nor a canoe, the only way to cross it was  walking on an old big  trunk which was lying down, peacefully, making the only connection between our side and the other. My mother and brothers had already crossed the river, and they were encouraging me to do the same from the other side of it, but I was paralysed with fear. Then, I suddenly realised that I had no choice, so I took all my courage,  a big deep breath, and crossed it! It was easier than I had thought!. That day, I learnt that I can do even things which, at first sight, seem impossible to be done. ",33.00

Then I'd like to join the activities, swimming and Singing. I love swimming and also I've got a scubar diving licence. I used to enjoy floting on the water whenever I was on holiday. Singing is the most favarite hobby for us. We often go out to sing in  Karaoke bar. My son experienced winning the first prize in a Karaoke competition. I'd like to know that how much monery,  how many clothes we need. It would be grateful if you sent me more details I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely Hana Soma  [SEP]  First of all we can't go shopping without money. Nowadays, most product's prices has gone up with our own country's economy development. Despite the poor material of product, we have to pay much money, even though we  completely satisfied  shopping at that time, we sometimes regret buying after the shopping. It sounds like foolish. However it often happen. Secondary the customer's service often makes us angry. Of couse, the shopkeepers are human being as well. But for their considerations, they're working in their rutines. So their attitude sometimes seems to be bossy and pushy. I sometimes loose my desire to buy a thing because of their badly behaviers. Moreover, shopping is just a part of life style. It's necessary to buy something to alive. We have to buy for some thing. For example, for our jobs supecial ceremonys and so on. Even when the risk comes up with shopping. To sum up, shopping is not always enjoyable for us ",24.0

Firstly I would like to tell you that the idea of organizing an International Arts Festival is fantastic, but in your advertisement it was said that I would find stars and artists from arround the world, when, in fact, they were from only six countries. I do understand that it must be difficult to get these people to go to the festival, but it would be nice if next year we could meet  other personalities. Secondly I belive you should know that a lot of people, including me, were not able to enjoy  concerts because some concert halls were too small. I would be very thankful if you could tell me if there will be more plays and films next year. Last but not least I would like you to know that I think the idea of the weekend ticket for all events was excellent because in the end it was cheaper than paying for each event separatelly. I hope you find my opinion useful. Once again congratulations on the Festival. I hope to hearing from you soon yours sincerelly,  [SEP]  tips  to earn money When the holidays began everybody is happy because it represents the beginning of a time full of fun and lots of interesting things to do, but in order to do these things we all need money and that is a big problem to most of us. there are several ways to earn a bit of money in your spare time. One of the most common examples is baby- sitting taking care of little children is easy and it doesn't require special skills, all you need is a lot of patience. If looking after children doesn't fit you, you can try  with pets. Lots of people would pay you to take their dog for a walk. So if you like animals this is your chance to earn  money and have fun at the same time. Another option is to wash your neighbour's car. In this case you need to buy the materials you will work with, but don't worry, soap is not very expensive. the most important thing is that you wisely choose the most suitable work for you, according to the things you like to do. If you don't find anything good enough for you don't worry, you should always remember: It's not all about the money! ",35.00
222," Dear Sir or Madam, I have seen the advertisement for the musical show and I realised that there were some mistakes. First of all, it is written that the stars were Danny Brook and Tina Truelove but the actor was not Danny Brook. The show should have started t 19.30. However it started at 20.15. We  kept waiting for 45 minutes. The tickets were sold for £10, £15 and £20. We were told that the discounts were available but they were not. We were planning to go to the theatre restaurant after the show but when we got there we saw that it was closed because of the cleaning. We had expected a brilliant show but we were very disappointed. I think the people who came there should be paid back. Faithfully,  [SEP]  If we compare a person who lived a very long time ago with another one who lives now, we will see a very big difference between their clothes. People used to wear very diffrent things from the clothes we wear now, we wouldn't even say that they are 'clothes'. We would probably think that these things they wore were just to cover and protect themselves. Nowadays the aim in clothing is not just for covering and protecting ourselves. People try to look nice and clean by wearing good clothes. The things that people wear are changing every time, everyone tries to be diffrent in the public and very different sorts of clothes are being created. The things we wear may not seem as if 'clothes' to the ones who will live 100 years from now. I belive they will wear very diffrent things. ",20.0
121," DEAR SIR, I AM WRITING TO COMPLAIN ABOUT A MUSICAL SHOW THAT IS TAKING PART IN THE CIRCLE THEATRE. I WAS WORRIED WHEN I SAW THE ADVERTISEMENT OF THE PLAY IN A NEWSPAPER ON SUNDAY. THE FIRST PROBLEM WAS WHEN I READ THE STARRING. IT SAID: 'DANNY BROOK'. BUT, WHEN I WAS WATCHING THE PLAY, I REALISED THAT THERE WAS A DIFFERENT ACTOR AND, REALLY, I WAS DISAPPOINTED. ANOTHER PROBLEM WAS THE TIME THAT I HAD TO WAIT. I THOUGHT IT WILL BE AT 19.30 AND I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR FORTY FIVE MINUTES!! BESIDES THIS, I COULD NOT VISIT THE RESTAURANT IN THE THEATRE BECAUSE IT WAS CLOSED. IN ADITION TO THIS, I DID NOT HAVE ANY DISCOUNT IN MY TICKET. SO, I HAD TO PAY A LOT OF MONEY TO SEE A PLAY THAT WAS A COMPLETELY DISASTER. TO SUM UP, I DID NOT SPEND A PERFECT EVENING. I THINK THAT IT WAS THE WORST I HAVE EVER HAD. ON THE WHOLE, I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE MY MONEY BACK. YOURS FAITHFULLY MANUELA BELABARA  [SEP]  JUST BE YOURSELF IN, THE FUTURE, PEOPLE WILL BE WEARING FASHIONABLE CLOTHES LIKE NOW. PEOPLE WILL BE VERY WORRIED ABOUT WHAT THEY WEAR. ONE THE ONE HAND, THERE WILL BE PEOPLE WHO WOULD WEAR FASHIONABLE CLOTHES. THIS PEOPLE WILL BE WORRIED ABOUT WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE. ON THE OTHER HAND, THERE WILL BE LESS PEOPLE WHO WOULD WEAR WHATEVER THEY LIKE. NOWADAYS, PEOPLE SEEM TO BE ALWAYS WORRIED. ALL THE TIME THEY ARE ASKING, WHAT ARE THEY LOOKING LIKE AND THEY WASTE A LOT OF MONEY IN CLOTHES. ON THE WHOLE, CLOTHES WILL HAVE NO CHANGE. IN MY OPINION, PEOPLE WILL GIVE IMPORTANCE TO HOW THEIR PERSONALITY DEVELOP AND THEY WILL GIVE UP WORRYING ABOUT WHAT THEY WEAR. THEY WILL HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO BUY WHAT THEY NEED AND TO BE HAPPY WITH IT. ",27.0
642," Dear Ms Ryan, I am writing to you to give  some requiered information. First of all, I am glad to hear that I won the first prize in your competition. I am happy to visit the United States under your organisation. Actually, I would like to go to Camp California next July because I have got two weeks holiday then. I also will be pleased to stay in  log cabins. My experience in camping is not so huge  to stay in  tents for 2 weeks. Therefore, you asked me what activities I would like to join . Surfing is something that I have ever wanted to try. As you can see, I have abosolutly no experience in it. Will it be possible to join a surf school? For the second activity I have chosen photography. I enjoy taking pictures of landscapes, I have also visited a photography course. So that my level is not  beginners anymore. Moreover, could you please tell me what kind of clothes I should take with me? What kind of money is used? I am looking forward to going on holidays. Yours sincerely, Mr Oliver Herre  [SEP]  Brighton, 13th June 2000 Dear Kim, Excuse me that I didn't write you sooner. As you know, I was fairly busy with my studying for my First Certificate. The concert was absolute marvellous! So many happy people in the crowds, that the atmosphere was infectious. Anyway, what you wanted to know was what has been my job. Actually my job was not really stressful, but I had contact  and access to all the famous Pop Stars. I had to bring them refreshments. That has been my dream since my childhood. I was a little bit disappointed about their attitude. They didn't really appreciate my service. Some of them were quite rude. Apart from that, it was an amazing experience. Whatever, if you ever will have the opportunity to do something like this then do it without hesitating. I liked to see their way of life. I hope you will write  me very soon and I hope you know more about my concert experience in the backstage area. Lots of love, ",31.0
349," Dear Sir/Madam. I am writting to inform  some problems we had. I want to the theatre to see ""over the rainbow"" at 17th June. First of all, we went to  ticket office to get the tickets. I thought we can buy discounts tickets according to the advertisement. However, we couldn't buy them the price. eventually, we got the tickets, Because we would like to see the musical and Danny Brook. After we arrive at the theatre, We were very disappointed. Because the different actor played  the musical that day. In addition, It started  20:15. We had to wait over 40 minitues. and we couldn't enjoy dinner at  theatre restaurant after the show. I think if the musical start late time, you should open the restaurant until late time. To tell the truth, we couldn't enjoy our evening. Would it be possible for me to back  money for  tickets. I am looking forward to hearing  you. Yours faithfully.  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. We had a secret. After we finish school, we usually gathered the place. Where do you think ? It was ship!! There was  beach  our town. One day, Freddie found it there. it was old and  little broken. But it was  most important place in the world. We always played there and it was  adventure for us. One day, Suddenly,  heavy storm came  our town. I went to the sea to see our ship. My friends had come there, too. We worried about it and we tryed to pull it. It seemed to sank into the sea, but fourtunately,  storm went  soon. Our ship left on the beach. And our parents and teachers , too. Because Pat called them. Of course we couldn't play there after that. But now, I am thinking about new secret our place. Where do you think ? It is a secret!! ",17.0
1038," Dear Mr. Robertson, Thank you very much for your programme but we have another plan  to go to the London Fashion and Leisure Show which unluckily  on the same day as the day we would visit the Science Museum so we would like you to change the plan a little. Your programme is very good, especially that we can go to visit the Science Museum which I heard is very good but a visit to the London Fashion and Leisure Show would be a good opportunity for us to see the lastest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and hair styles and it is free for students too. So we think we should change your programme by going to the Science Museum on Wednesday afternoon and to do the shopping after the show. Thank you very much and we look forward to hearing from you. With great respect,  [SEP]  It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. I climed up the tree. My friend was looking at me from below. I went on climbing until I saw my friend's model aeroplane. If I hadn't borrowed it from him, I wouldn't have been here. No, it wasn't the time to regret , just get it and it would be all over. I stressed my arm, the branch I was standing on broke and I fell down on my leg. It was very hurt, my friend rushed to me than ran back to my house and called Mom. I can't remember anything else until I woke up at a hospital, lying on a bed with my leg in plaster. The nurse sitting beside me said to me, 'Your mother would like to have a word with you,' then she went out. Mom came in, looking very angry, I prayed for a short conversation. ",28.00
738," Dears sirs: I would like to travel in July, before is not possible for me, I'll have to finish my exams', the lastest of them will be on  30th of Juny. About my Accommodation I prefer the tents, I like them, every year I go 15 days out with my tent and some friends. I like to sleep outside on the grass. The weather will be no cold doesn't it?

1237," Dear Mrs Smith, I would like to thank you for your letter. I am sorry to learn that Richard Brown cannot attend the conference. Please transmit him my best wishes for his recovery. We have booked rooms for all members of your group at the Palace Hotel. It is a very cosy building that is on the same avenue as the conference building, approximetively one mile away. There is a direct bus link between the two locations: this is  bus line number six; the bus station for the conference building is called ""Avenue de cour"" and the one at the Palace Hotel is named ""Main station"". Concerning the party we do not have a casual dressing code. students usually wear dark clothes with a tie for the boys and a mid-long skirt or dress for the girls. There are a lot of activities you can do during your free afternoon. I would like to suggest visiting the ""Ethnographic Museum,, which is kind of unique in the world. Looking forward to meeting you soon I remain, yours sincerely.  [SEP]  The car: I think that the car is one of the human inventions that has the most affected the way of life of people from industrial countries. Nowadays more than the percents of the world industry is related to the automotive business: car manufacturing, gasoline extracting and refining, tyres recycling, and so on. The industrial countries have encountered deep evolution of their strictures since the car has been made available to everyone. At the beginning of the last Century only a few very rich people could afford a car; it was  kind of leisure or sport to drive one. Today almost everyone owns a car and needs it for daily activities. The transport network has changed according to this social evolution. The increasing number of cars related and infrastructure are now creeting problems. A lot of roads and motorways are overcrowded, and enviromment issues are more and more related to the intensive use of cars and lorries. People and governments are concerned about how to limit the effects of cars on the enviromment without impacting their mobility. This will be a tough challenge for this new century. ",29.00
861," Dear Sir/Madam, I was very pleased to receive your letter which informed me of my winning the first prize in your competition, namely two weeks at Camp California in the USA. To begin with, I would like to travel in July. This is the only possible time for me, as the school holiday starts on the 29th of June. And from August on I planed to do some part-time job in order to earn some pocket money. Referring to the possibilities of accommodation, I'd prefer log cabins to tents. Firstly, log cabins are more comportable than tents. Secondly, I do not like tents. Last not least, I always have backache after sleeping in a tent for a couple of days. As I had been asked to choose two activities I would like to  during my stay at the camp, I chose Golf and singing. I have never played Golf actually, but I would love to try something new. As for singing, I am very keen on singing as I get lessons in it. I just love singing. I would like to know whether there is some facilities for washing the Clothes. Especially in summer, clothes get dirty very easily. Lastly, does the prize include pocket money? If not, I will have to bring some with me. Is there a possibility of exchanging different currancies to US dollar? I ask you to enclose the answer in your reply. I look forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience. Yours faithfully Mee-Yon Areum.  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable. When you think of shopping, it reminds you of going out (mostly) with friends, looking for new things like clothes, accesoires etc. and buying them. It sounds nice and shopping is great fun - or it should be. Nowadays shopping can be very stressful. It all starts with the search of an appropriate parking-space which can last annoyingly long, especially at weekends. Nevertheless, the nightmare starts when you enter the shopping mall or the passage, which is terribly crowded. You cannot make a step without ""touching"" the others. It gets enormously unbearable in hot summer days, when the temperature increases. In such a situation your friends or the people you are shopping with get lost very easily and looking for them can be very tiring. But the worst moment comes, if you cannot find the thing you were looking for, because it is no longer trendy or because it is sold out. Of course, shopping is not always so unpleasant, but sometimes it is simply better to stay at home. ",34.0
941," Dear Ms Ryan  I am writing in reply to your letter on the 15th  May. I would like to provide some further information you are asking me for. First, I am able to come only in July, because my examination session is due from the 24 June till 26 June. I would prefer to be accomodated in a log cabin as  do not like sleeping on the mattres and I get  allergy to rubber. From the listed activities I would like to choose singing, because it is my hobby and I also sing in  local chorus. Photography is my second favourite subject. I won third prize in  competition organized by our college. Could you, pleas send me some extra information regarding the ammount of money I should take to cover any other expenses, and also, what kind of clothes I should take. I am looking forward to hearing from you Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Is shopping not always enjoyable? There are different opinions and points of view. I like shopping very much. Firstly, you have a wide variety of shops you can buy food . For example, large supermarkets with dishes ready to eat. Even if you do not have any cooking skills you can enjoy exotic meals. On the other hand, some people complain that there are a lot of artificial products, which are quite unhealthy, but very expensive. The second thing I like about shopping is the possibility to find your own style  buying clothes in the small boutiques. You can always ask for good advice from the experienced shop attendants, which does not necessarily cost you extra money. However, someone else may say, it takes too much time. The third reason I enjoy shopping is that I never go alone just to buy a thing I need. I always take my friend with me so we can chat or have coffee in the shop's cafe. Although my brother thinks the better way to have fun is to watch TV than to be pushed in crowded shops, I do not agree. To sum up I agree that shopping is not always enjoyable, but for me it is and I like it. ",33.0
435," Dear Sir or Madam, Unfortunatelly I have to complained about  musical show  in your's Circle Theatre last evening. When I become your's advertisment concerning the show ""Over the Rainbow"" I thought that I'll have a great evening, but unfortunatelly it was a big disappointment for me. Maybe I start for the beginning. First of all, Danny Brook - the main actor in this musical - was abbsend. The show had a 45 minutes delay - what a shame! You also offered discounts, whot kind of discounts? I haven't seen any! I was with my son (11 years old) and I had to paid a full-prize for his ticket. Becouse the show was very long, we were getting hungry but of course your's theatre restaurants was closed because of  holiday. Hereby I have to ask for  money back or another discounts for me. Waiting for you replay. With best regards  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. The stay has begaun last year, when I stated my summer holiday. I had not any money for travelling but my parents were able to give me them if I only had a concret plans. I started talking with my parents that I will be travelling with my friends through West-Europe for one month. I had really a good plan but any good friends. I become quite a lot of money and I left home. During one week I was really travelling with my friends but then I was getting boring with them and I started to travel alone. Now I don't think that it was a good idea. Sometimes I had to sleep on a railway-stations or under a bridges. After one mounth I came home back and explained my parents how a lot of fun had I with my friends - I don't know why I was such a lair. My parents belived my word's untill my younger brother Pat told them the true. Now my parents' don't belive my words. But I think, this was a good lesson for me and I  lair any more. ",23.0
29," Dear Ms J. Clark, I am writing to you to thank  for  so good organisation of  International Arts Festival, where I'd spent two exellent days recently. I would like to inform you whed the idea was great and I hope that so needful for people events would become a good tradition in our country. I think that providing such festivals could help people to be in the centre of cultural life of the world and to have enough information about the new art styles But I hope that next year visitores of  festival would be able to introduce with more art groups from all over the world. I suggest it would be very intresting to meet artists from far and exotic countries. Also, if I were you I would make your concert halls a bit larger, because of too many people would like to spend their holidays with their families on your festival next year Event this year some halls, which I had visited were overcrowded and there were some problems with ventilation during some shows Finishing my letter, I hope what my notes could help you to make next-year festival more intersting and comfortable for  public Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Want to be independent? Earn   yourself. Everybody knows that common students are not the richest persons in the world. But then you are at the university you need money more, then anybody else want. It is so because you are young and need to make your life as intrestng as it can be now. All that discos, concerts,  touristic trips have to be paid  by a different sum of those small coloured pieces of paper, called money Of course, the easiest way to have them is to ask your parents for help, but a great number of young persons want to be independent. So thy need to get a job  that is very difficult when you haven't  any special education and experience yet. Most common way to earn  is baby-sitting. Many young people earn their pocket money so, helping neighbouring parents to have a bit more spare time. Other students work as house or office managers, make promontion of different goods or even  as a bouncer. Naturally, it's easier to get a job then you were good in foreign languagers or computers. When you can find yourself  as a tourist guide or as a secretary. Sometimes small groups of students organized their own small business. For example, they can design furniture or clothes, make web-sites and so on. In two words, if the young man want to earn a bit of money by his own hands, the luck and success will find him ",26.00
332," Saturday, 17th June, 2000 Dear Sir, I am writting  you in order to obtain you my money back, concerning the musical show: OVER THE RAINBOW. I live in France and I recently spent a week's holiday in London. I decided to go to  theatre to have a nice evening. I saw your advertisement in a newspaper. It seemed to be very attractive. But in fact it is not! I had a very disappointing evening. First of all:  actors  were mentionned  are not the same  . I supposed to see the famous Danny Brook, and what a surprise it was  not him. I was very disappointed. Secondly the show had go on 19.30 pm. In fact it started at 20.15 pm without any explanations. Thirdly it said that ""discounts available"". This is not the truth. After that it suggested  to visit your theatre restaurant, but the restaurant was closed! It is a shame. And you write, I quote  ""your perfect evening out"", excuse me but I do not agree with you. It was awful, the worst evening out of my life. So please, it would be fair, that you give  my money back. I am looking forward to hearing from you in a near future. Yours faithfully.  [SEP]  ""What will clothes be like 100 years from now?"" In my opinion, clothes will not change so much, because fashion is an eternal cycle. You will find always  basic clothes, but I think that it will be the materials which will change. We will find the same kind of clothes with gadgets included. For example: a short very classical   inside of it could be included a mobile phone, or we could find too some buttons, to have.. fresh air, why not? Or special flying shoes, and maybe on your watch you would have a screen to watch your favorite soap operas. Everything is possible, but it would be fun to see this type of gadgets with old clothes, like a dress of the middle-Age. Do not worry about this, it will not happen! Fashion is always the same! ",27.0
214," Dear Sir or Madam, I recently visited your theatre to see the musical show ""over the rainbow"". I was very disappointed because the actors wasn't Danny Brook and Tina Truelove. Instead of them you had different actors. Then the show delayed, it started at 20:15, not at 19.30. I had to wait 45 minutes! Another point is that the discounts wasn't available although I could red  it before at your notice. After the show was finished, I decided to drink something, but as I arrived in the restaurant it had been closed. But in your advertisement you wrote that people can visit the resaurant after the show. I can't understand such kind of mistakes. You wrote also that the evening would be perfect. For me it wasn't and because of that I ask you to give me my money back. If you can't give me all the money back then do it particularly. I  give you my phone number, you can reach me from 8 o'clock till 12 o'clock: 08532143251 Please call me back soon. Yours faithfully Carolina Schwitt  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed your daily life? Modern technology has changed my daily life in the point that all I do is becoming more comfortable. For example when I have to write a letter or do my homework, I always write it on the computer. If I search  something like a telefonnumber or an adress I also look it up from the internet. I use also the internet when I need any informations for example  I need them for school or private for myself. A few years ago I had to go in a library and look it up in many books. Most that took a long time. I think the advantage of modern technology is that all I do goes very fast and I have more time for my hobbys or for friends. Another important point for me is that things like listening  music or watching TV sounds better and the pictures on TV are being impoved, because the machines become more better. And also a good intention for me is the Handy, because everywhere I go I can talk to other people. ",24.0
1222," Dear Mrs Smith, I have recieved your letter this morning. I am sorry to hear that Richard is ill and is unable to attempt the conference; I am glad that you are able to be the leader of the group. I hope that these informations below are very useful to you, during your attempt of  conference. I have booked a hotel not far off from our school. The hotel is called  Epsom Down Hotel. Your plane will arrive in England by 9:00. There will be a coach waiting for you, and the driver will be next to the information desk. You should arrive at the hotel by 11:00. You will than have an hour to check in and unpack all your luggage. The conference will start on time at 12:30, so I would suggest you to leave  hotel by 12:00. The best way to get to the conference is to follow along the collage road and turn left toward the end, you than keep going straight, you will eventually see the main entrance of the collage. When you get into the college you can just ask any boys in the college where to go from then. They all knows where the conference is and when. At the end of the conference, we will have a party. The party is to let all the students  to know each other better. The party will be in the dance hall next to the conference room. I will suggust them to wear formal clothing, as in tie, trousers and blaser. For the afternoon free time on the last day. There are a wide variety of choices  that they can do. They can play tennis, do athletics, swimming... and many other sports event in our school, if they want to. Or they can also visit the Epsom Town. There are shops which sales cloths, foods, and books ... They can decide what they want to do, it's entirely up to them. I am looking forward to seeing you and hop you have a safe flight over to England. Your sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear group leader, Welcome to Taiwan. This report is based on an interesting building, where you can take, for your students to visit. This building is situated in Taipei, the capital. The building is called  Chiang Kei-shek Momerial Hall. Nearly everyone knows where this building is, so if you have a chance, just ask the local people in Taipei about this building. The momerial Hall is surrounded by large playgrounds. As you go into the main Hall, you will see a huge statue of Chiang Kei-shek, this is because the building is the rememberence of how well Chiang did in History. The statue is about 20 feet high. Next to the statue is protected by the guards, the guards will change every four hours. Apart from the main Hall, there are also lots of other gallaries. In these gallaries there are Historical paintings, antique furnitures which Chiang used. These treasure are very old, even older than the history of America. All these treasures were brought over to Taiwan by Chiang during the defeat in China. They are all been well look after. As well as all the treasures, statue and historical paintings...There are also restaurent's and modern gallaries. When you are tired after looking around you might want to buy drinks or something to eat, or if you are fed up with historical thing, you migh as well just pop into the modern gallery to see things which are more modern. Finally, if you went to visit this building I will recommend you to stay at a hotel not far from the momerial Hall called  Hyatt Hotel. It only take about five minutes if you walk. I hope you will all have a great time in Taiwan and I hope you will enjoy the building.  ",36.00
747," Dear Mrs Helen Ryan, I am writing in reply to your letter that I have just received. I am very happy to win first prize in your competition. - two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. I am also very excited about it. If it is possible I would like to travel in July. This is the only month that I will be free. Because I am studying the Management and Finance at university and it will finish at the end of June. I will be in italy in August. Because I need to improve my italian and I am taking a very important exam next year. I would be appreciate it if I could stay in  tents at  Camp. Because I usually go on camping-site holiday, with my friends. It is great fun. I really like staying in tents. It is also written in your letter that we will have to  chance to do two activities. I am really good at playing tennis and singing. I have been playing tennis for five years and I love it. I play the classicial guitar and I also sing songs. I have been playing the classicial guitar for three years. It is quite difficult but I like difficult things. I wonder if you could tell me about the wheather and what kind of clothes I have to bring with me. I would also like to know how much money I need. I look forward to receiving your reply Yours sincerely,  [SEP]   RIGHT TIME FOR SHOPPING Why do people like shopping? First answer is that they need  shopping. Second answer is that the shopping makes everyone happy. If I get bored I can't stay at home and I feel  going shopping. When I do shopping I don't think about any problems I have. It's very relaxing for me but  if it is possible to do  shopping. Sometimes it can be nightmare if you can't find something that you are looking for. I think the weekends are not the right time to go shopping. I went shopping last week with my friend she needed to buy a nightdress. We spent for three hours and we couldn't buy anything. It was incredibly crowded. We couldn't even move and the most people were just looking and were wasting of their time. If you are in a hurry, don't go shopping! It is not really  good idea to go shopping if you don't have enough time. Imagine you have three children and you are going shopping with them. I can tell you how bad  situation you are in because when I was a child I always had an argument with my mother about shopping. I can remember how upset I was if my mother didn't buy what I wanted and how much I cried. It was very ashameful for my mum. She was also very angry. Because she never managed to get me out from the toy shop. As you see shopping is not always enjoyable. Always make sure that  is  right time to go shopping. ",34.0

I would like to come next year with a great pleasure. I hope you will not  angry if I give you some advice? At first, I would like to talk about your section ""Stars and Artists"". This section is really great and attract a lot of people. From my point of view, it will better if you have some ""Stars and Artists"" from only six countries. Because the spectators will probably  more interested in your festival if they know the celebrities. I also would like to talk about your concerts. The concerts are fabulous but the problems are the halls. They are too small for all the people. Could you do something for these problems? All the sections of your festival were great but I think there were not a lot of ""Plays and films"". I love films and Plays also, and I'll hope to have more films or Plays next year. Concerning the tickets, I think your price is reasonable for this festival. It is a good idea to have reasonably-priced  for weekends. I'm looking forward do hearing from you, Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Dear Phil, I'm really happy to receive your letter and I hope you are fine. I'm fine but I have a lot of work to do for my school.

672," Dear Mrs Ryan, I am writing in reply to your letter asking for further information from me. First of all, I would like to travel in July because this is the beggining of my holidays, and I would not like to miss some of my school classes. Besides, I would preffer to stay in  tents, because I got used to being in tents since each summer I spent my holidays with my friends at the hills. In adittion, I would rather playing tennis. When I was younger I won the National Tennis Championship. I also like surfing, I think it is a dangerous sport, but I know how to practice it, because of the fact that last year a proffessional surfer tought me. However, I would like to know what kind of clothes I should take and if it is possible for you to tell me how much money I will need. I would appreciate it if you could send me a reply at your earliest convenience. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  From my point of view, shopping is not always enjoyable, because sometimes when you are looking for a special good you never find it. Besides, I do not like to waste my time just seeing at a wide variety of products, that make you feel confused and you don't know which one fits you, instead of being with my friends or doing something else. I think that when you want to buy something you have to be sure of what you really need, if not the shop assistant has the ability to persuade you to buy something you do not want. Moreover in the shops that sales fashionable clothes. Although it is wonderful to buy new things, there are times that it really become tiring. To summarize, I could say that if you want to buy something, first make sure what sort of product you need and then, go shopping. If not shopping  never be enjoyable, but also tiring and boring.
